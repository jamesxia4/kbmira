Berlusconi at Bay
Silvio Berlusconi , who becomes President of the European Union on July 1

Fifteen years later , Signor Berlusoni understood that the Italian state &apos;s monopoly of television would not survive and jump-started what became Italy &apos;s main privately owned media group .
But you don &apos;t win in TV and the real estate business without the right political connections .
On both occasions , Berlusconi outwitted his competitors by siding with the Socialists , at the time the rising stars of Italian political life .
His long association with Bettino Craxi , Milan &apos;s most influential politician in the 1970 &apos;s and Italy &apos;s prime minister through much of the 1980 &apos;s , started early .
On the other hand , political connections do not make a politician .
Indeed , the jump from business into politics was probably not Berlusconi &apos;s own preference .
By the 1990 &apos;s , his media group was in trouble , weakened by excessive diversification ( the decision to enter the retail-distribution business almost destroyed the group ) .
Almost at the same time , ex-premier Craxi fled to Tunisia , chased there by the Italian courts at the height of the mani pulite ( clean hands ) investigation into the vast network of corruption known as Tangentopoli ( Bribesville ) .
Craxi &apos;s flight and exile left Berlusconi feeling lost--and without the reliable political backing that he needed .
So he decided that he needed to become his own political sponsor .
As has happened frequently in Italian history , Berlusconi &apos;s decision to form a new political party , Forza Italia , just a few months before the 1994 general election paid off handsomely .
Berlusconi &apos;s lack of experience in politics doomed his first government to collapse after only six months .
Any other man as rich as Berlusconi would probably have given up .
But Berlusconi remained and led the opposition for six years .
In 2001 his determination was rewarded with a clear victory and , more importantly , a seemingly clear mandate for change .
Once again Berlusconi probably had no choice : by the late 1990 &apos;s , his association with the disgraced Socialists was haunting him politically and legally .
His only hope of fending off the magistrates was to control parliament and introduce new laws that would stop the series of corruption trials he faces--a strategy that has now given him immunity from prosecution until he leaves office .
Unfortunately , while Berlusconi &apos;s government is invariably long on speeches , legal provisions designed to stop the clock on his court cases are among the few laws that have passed in his two years of government .
Berlusconi &apos;s performance in government is a combination of good intuition--for instance the early attempt to reform Italian pensions in 1994--and poor implementation , most likely because of a lack of courage , as surprising as that seems .
In 1994 , during his first government , he understood early on that Italy needed to overhaul its pension system , and introduced bold legislation .
But one general strike was enough to kill his reformist zeal .
More recently , he courageously sided with the US on the war in Iraq , against the majority of the country and most of his own political coalition .
But soon he seemed scared of his own boldness and faded into an almost invisible ally .
Despite Berlusconi &apos;s rhetoric , he did not go ( or was not invited ) to the summit meeting with President Bush in the Azores , where the final decision to go to war was taken .
On labor reforms , he fought the unions head on , but he chose the wrong fight : Italy &apos;s infamous &quot; Article 18 , &quot; which allows labor courts to return a worker to his job if a judge believes that the worker was unjustly fired .
But while Article 18 is important in principle , it is almost irrelevant in practice .
The outcome was a confrontation with the unions that distracted from more important labor reforms .
Contrary to what happened in 1994 , Berlusconi &apos;s current government survives , but whoever hoped for a free-market revolution will be disappointed .
There has been no tax cut of any significance , and pension reform is still waiting .
Berlusconi &apos;s powerful finance minister , Giulio Tremonti , speaks often and fondly of the necessity of renewed government intervention in the economy ; nothing is done to prevent strikes in the public transportation sector .
Moderate right-wing voters , who wanted an Italian ( i.e. , somewhat watered-down ) version of the Reagan / Thatcher era are disillusioned .
Berlusconi tries to mask his inactivity by scaring his voters , repeating again and again that electing the moderate left would mean signing a pact with the devil , i.e. , the &quot; communists . &quot;
Italians seem smarter , as the result of the June administrative elections clearly have shown .
Why has the courageous visionary of the 1960 &apos;s and 1970 &apos;s lost his shine ?
Part of it is precisely that it is no longer the 1960 &apos;s and 1970 &apos;s : Berlusconi is 40 years older and for the past ten years has lived in the world of Roman politics .
There he learned the art of political ( and personal ) survival , but lost his vision and his love for risk taking .
Closing the US-Europe Technology Gap
In the second half of the 1990 &apos;s , Europe &apos;s average annual growth rate of productivity amounted to 0.7 % , while the US hummed along at 1.4 % .
However , if we distinguish between the industries that produce information and communications technologies ( ICT ) and those that are simply users of such technologies , we can see that the productivity growth gap stems almost entirely from the weakness of Europe &apos;s ICT producing sector .
Annual productivity growth in sectors that are users of ICT technologies averaged 0.63 % in the US between 1995 and 2000 , and a very similar 0.41 % in Europe .
This confirms a well known fact : Europe is less efficient than the US at producing research that is conducive to innovation--either because Europe allocates fewer resources to research , or because the available resources are used less efficiently , or both .
To be sure , total spending on research and development is lower in Europe than in the US , but not by much .
In the 1990 &apos;s , the US devoted 2.8 % of GDP annually on R &amp; D , compared with 2.3 % in Germany , 2 % in the UK , and 1.9 % in France .
Still , European governments typically complain about the lack of fiscal resources to support R &amp; D ( a far fetched argument given the miniscule share of research spending in the oversized European budgets ) and , whenever the European Commission allows them , they subsidize innovative firms , or those that they think are more likely to invest in R &amp; D.
France and Italy , for example , demanded that the limits imposed the budget deficits of euro zone members by the Stability and Growth Pact exclude public spending for research .
Similarly , the French government decided to bail out Alstom--a company that developed a number of high-tech products , including the TGV , the French fast train--before ending up bankrupt .
But both tactics are unlikely to boost the European high-tech sector .
Why ?
Because weakness in research is not--at least not primarily--a funding issue .
Subsidies will not produce efficient high-tech firms .
Let us consider research first .
Europe trails the US in every dimension : the number of patents , the number of Nobel laureates , the number of researchers it is able to attract from the rest of the world .
But funding is only part of the problem .
A euro spent on research in Europe is less productive than a dollar spent in the US for two reasons : incentives and the demand for technology .
We fear that spending more money without changing archaic university rules would produce more waste , not more research output .
It would only increase the power , prestige , and resources of entrenched lobbies of established university professors who often prevent entry and competition .
Demand for technology is also important .
It helps focusing research , it provides deadlines , screens the output , and allows patents to be valued at market prices .
Without the incentives provided by those on the receiving end of its output , research risks drifting along , often without clear direction .
Admittedly this is not true in all fields : the study of Ancient Greek fragments is valuable even it meets hardly any demand .
But it is important in those fields , both theoretical and applied , that might be used as an input in the production of new technologies : physics , biology , chemistry , engineering , etc .
But it is defense spending that is the major factor in the demand for research .
Most technological breakthroughs in the postwar period--from microchips to the Internet to the new batteries for cellular phones developed for the US Army in Iraq--had , at least initially , a military application .
Cell phones , satellite tracking , and high-resolution cameras are not cheap to come by , but happily for the industries that use them , costs for their development have been partly picked up by the government .
One key reason for the superiority of the US in research is the size and the composition of defense expenditure .
The Pentagon &apos;s budget is not simply big : it accounts for more than one half of all US government spending on research and development : in France , defense spending is only around a quarter of the total .
In 1999 , US spending on defense-related R &amp; D was 0.45 % of GDP ; the UK and France were next , but with just half as much , 0.26 % and 0.22 % , respectively .
As the Alstom case suggests , the French have a different model in mind .
Rather than supporting R &amp; D with large defense budgets , they prefer to do it directly , subsidizing French high-tech firms .
The official justification is that national defense budgets are too small to create the demand that would be needed to support R &amp; D in high-tech sectors , while there is still no European defense budget .
This is no coincidence : if allocated competitively , such a supra-national budget would identify winners and losers .
But many European countries still refuse to accept that some of their high-tech firms might not make it : better , they think , to keep them alive with generous subsidies , and in the meantime avoid the consolidation of EU defense budgets .
By integrating its defense expenditures and increasing their size , Europe would hit two birds with one stone .
It would be more credible when it demands to be heard at international bargaining tables , particularly vis-à-vis the US , and it would stimulate scientific research .
The way to achieve these goals is not to run larger deficits , which merely imply higher taxes tomorrow , but to cut spending in other parts of the budget .
In short : short-run pain for long-run gain .
The American Way of Debt
After almost 15 years of unprecedented growth - interrupted only by a brief slowdown in 2000-2001 - the United States has accumulated a huge stock of foreign liabilities , equivalent to 25 % of its GDP .
With the current account deficit now exceeding 5 % of GDP , US foreign debt is rising fast .
But no country can accumulate debt forever - and what cannot last sooner or later must end .
In early 1985 , when the US current account deficit reached $ 120 billion , about a third of today &apos;s level at current prices , the rest of the world stopped financing it .
The outcome was a sudden fall in the value of the dollar , which depreciated by 50 % against the Deutschemark .
Europe should not welcome a sequel .
Indeed , the world itself cannot afford the disappearance of the US current account deficit - at least not quickly .
Take away US imports and the timid growth Europe has seen in the past year would immediately disappear .
This may already be happening : the appreciation of the euro , from $ 1.20 to $ 1.30 in the past few months , was enough to bring European growth to a standstill during the third quarter of this year .
Before the dollar started to weaken , exports from the 25 EU member states were growing at 6.5 % per year , compared with 2 % for consumption and 3 % for investment .
Even in Japan , the recent recovery was almost entirely led by exports .
But as the yen strengthens , Japan , too , seems to stop growing .
With central banks around the world full of dollars and trade imbalances becoming worrisome , there are three possible solutions .
One is that domestic saving in the US increases .
But this is unlikely , at least in the near future , given President Bush &apos;s ambitious fiscal plans and the continuing war in Iraq .
US private savings are also slightly negative , and an increase might lead to a slowdown in the short run .
The second possibility is a more pronounced devaluation of the dollar , bringing it well beyond the current levels relative to both the euro and the yen .
Revaluation of the Chinese yuan would also help .
The third option is a pick up of growth in Europe , which would increase US exports .
This could happen only if European companies cut costs and increase productivity .
As always , a litany of plans and promises for &quot; structural reforms &quot; can be heard , but none of them is likely to be implemented anytime soon .
So what can be done ?
One alternative is to increase working hours without increasing salary per hours proportionally .
Americans and Europeans worked the same number of hours in the early 1970 &apos;s .
Today , Europeans work 50 % less on average in France and Germany than in the US .
This is partly due to higher taxes in Europe , and this cannot be undone : nobody can force someone to work if they consider their take-home pay too low because of a high marginal tax rate .
But the relative decline in work hours is also due to trade unions &apos; success in winning compulsory vacation time .
Labor reform leading to longer hours would not reduce the total income of the employed , but it would reduce production costs .
Some discussion of this idea is beginning to appear in the press and , it is to be hoped , behind close doors among policymakers and union leaders .
Until this happens , it is in the rest of the world &apos;s interest to let the US continue to run an unprecedented current account deficit by financing it at the rate of $ 500 billion per year .
This allows the Chinese to keep their currency stable vis-à-vis the dollar , remain super-competitive , and thus enable a gradual shift of 200 million workers from agriculture into manufacturing , the authorities &apos; aim over the next 10 years .
In Europe , America &apos;s external deficit keeps the sole source of growth alive .
But , again , this will not last forever .
Eventually , Europe will have to stop thinking that the US can save its economy and will have to start relying on its own resources .
But don &apos;t be surprised if the next European downturn will be blamed on the US and the depreciation of the dollar .
It is always useful to have a scapegoat .
Abba Eban : The Voice of Israel
For almost two generations , Abba Eban was Israel &apos;s voice - its messenger to the high and mighty among the nations as well as to the Jewish people all over the world .
Since he first appeared at the side of Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940 &apos;s during the struggle for Jewish statehood and sovereignty , few people could articulate the Zionist and later the Israeli case with comparable eloquence and conviction .
With his Churchillian prose and almost Shakespearean cadences , his mellifluous phrases and sonorous voice carried for decades a message of hope from a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the horrors of World War II .
As Ambassador to the United States and the UN , and later as Foreign Minister , he represented an Israel with which the world &apos;s liberal imagination could identify .
Larger and more powerful nations were envious of so a powerful spokesman , and his speeches became textbook models for statesmen and diplomats in distant lands .
His books - which he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy - were a unique combination of enormous erudition and crystalline clarity .
His scholarly training and rhetorical gifts supplemented each other in a rare fashion .
Rarely has a small country been represented by a statesman of such world stature : only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts come to mind to compare with him .
He was a true patriot , in the old-fashioned sense of the word : proud of his people , but never ethno-centric ; a man of the world , but deeply embedded in Jewish cultural heritage ; focused on the plights and tribulations of the Jewish people , but never losing the universal horizon of mankind .
In short , he was a modern Jew in the best sense of the word .
It was said of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol that he spoke seven languages , all of them in Yiddish .
Of Eban it could be said that he spoke ten languages , and all of them with an Oxford / Cambridge accent .
Yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of Israeli politics .
Perhaps Eban was too urbane , too much of a scholar and gentleman to be able to make it - in Disraeli &apos;s phrase - to the top of the greasy pole .
Together with Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War .
He could hardly have been held responsible for the hubris which led to the avalanche of 1973 , yet it nonetheless brought him down as well .
He never found his way back , and when confronted with the New Politics of primaries and populism , he became dispirited when he could not cope with this new style .
In the international arena , Eban &apos;s pen was his sword , and the spoken word his lance .
He was less adept in political infighting in Israel .
He could be a fierce turf fighter , yet it is fair to say that he could have fought harder for his moderate and dovish views in the post-1967 government in which he served .
It is far from clear if he would have prevailed , given his lack of an independent political base , but his international prestige and standing might have given him a chance if he would have chosen to throw the gauntlet .
He never did .
Eban &apos;s silence in the last years was not only a product of his disenchantment with Israeli politics or his failing health .
At a time when public debate in Israel is torn between pseudo-religious nationalist fanatics and anti-Zionists masquerading as post-modernists , the moral certitudes of Eban , for all their urbanity , may sound shallow .
But nation-building requires moral stamina , and Eban provided it to his people and the world in abundance .
Without having spoken to Eban in the last few years , I have no doubt that he would be extremely unhappy about the turn of events after the failure of Camp David and Taba in 2000-01 , and the present course of Israeli policies would fill him with foreboding .
Yet in all probability he would have been even more deeply disappointed in the inability of the Palestinians to come to terms with the existence of the Jewish state .
As an Arabist by training , immersed in Arab and Muslim culture , he always hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated , that an Arab and Muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism .
This was the bedrock of his hope for reconciliation between Jew and Arab .
That this Arab renaissance - to use the phrase of the great Palestinian scholar George Antonius - did not take place may have been Eban &apos;s greatest disappointment .
Despite the high-born image Eban projected , he was an extremely vulnerable person : what some occasionally discerned as traits of vanity may have had their origins in his humble origins .
While appearing to own the Queen &apos;s English , Eban was not to the manor born : he came from the extremely modest fringes of Anglo-Jewry .
He was , in the true sense of the word , a self-made man , whose pluck , ambition , drive and inner belief in his destiny carried him to the pinnacle of his achievements .
His was the aristocracy of the spirit .
In this Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he so gloriously represented .
A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip , as well as some settlements in the West Bank , has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world .
Many denounced Sharon &apos;s plan as a trick .
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start .
Despite the way it often looks to outsiders , debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves .
Like everything in Israel , the process is more complicated , especially where the hawks are concerned .
Basically , there are two species of Israeli hawks : call one kind ideological and the other strategic .
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel , the homeland of the Jewish people .
For them , the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony , which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria .
Not all ideological hawks are religious , although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies .
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists , and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists .
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category .
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud .
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky , who founded &quot; Revisionist &quot; Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel &apos;s Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion .
Then there are the strategic hawks .
For them , given Israel &apos;s narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity , controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative , but is driven by security considerations .
For them , Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands , but security outposts , aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland .
They may be right or wrong in this assessment , but it is not an ideological one .
Ariel Sharon , who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky &apos;s ideas - is a strategic hawk .
For ideological hawks , compromises are treason : how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people , let alone God &apos;s promise to Abraham ?
Strategic hawks , however , are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes .
It is in this context that Sharon &apos;s moves should be seen .
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security .
He has brought neither .
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein , the danger of an &quot; Eastern front &quot; against Israel has diminished .
Absent a Palestinian partner , and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel &apos;s harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking : set up an effective barrier , move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements , and wait for another day .
If one follows Sharon &apos;s statements in the last year , a clear pattern emerges .
First , he admitted that &quot; eventually &quot; a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks .
A few months later , he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of &quot; liberated &quot; rather than &quot; occupied &quot; territories .
Last December , he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement , and that this would entail the &quot; relocation &quot; of some settlements .
Although this was still merely verbiage , it was novel language for a Likud prime minister .
Sharon &apos;s latest statements , though , explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated ; the Director of the National Security Council , General Giora Eiland , was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations , including compensation for relocated settlers .
All of this has radically altered Israel &apos;s domestic political map .
Some ideological hawks in Sharon &apos;s government threatened to resign ; Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net ; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government .
The test , of course , is not in the planning , but in the implementation of withdrawal , and the road is long and bumpy .
Sharon &apos;s timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption .
Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon &apos;s future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir , Sharon comes from the military , and for him security - not ideology - is supreme .
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise .
Victors &apos; Justice , Iraqi-Style
Saddam Hussein is dead , but not all Iraqis are celebrating .
On the contrary , the way in which the various religious and ethnic groups in Iraq responded to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty of holding Iraq together as a coherent entity .
To the Shiite majority , long brutally oppressed by Saddam and all previous Sunni-dominated Iraqi regimes , Saddam &apos;s death symbolizes their attainment of political hegemony .
Moreover , their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated , they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves .
To the Sunni minority , pushed from power by the American invasion and giving vent to their frustration with daily attacks on the Shi &apos;a population and their holy sites , Saddam will remain a hero for a long time to come .
The Kurds -- who , like the Shi &apos;a , were victimized by Saddam for decades -- quietly cling to their de facto independence in the north , making sure that they will never again come under Arab rule .
Iraq &apos;s prime minister , Nuri el-Maliki , representing the ruling Shi &apos;a-Kurdish coalition , expressed the hope that the dictator &apos;s end would help to heal the sectarian divides .
But , however sincere his words may sound , reality is moving in the opposite direction , and the ugly verbal exchanges surrounding the act of execution itself will certainly do little to dispel the notion that this was &quot; victors &apos; justice &quot; -- the victors being not the United States , but the Shi &apos;a .
None of this augurs well for the future of what we should get used to calling &quot; the former Iraq . &quot;
Indeed , the Washington debate surrounding how to &quot; fix Iraq &quot; is irrelevant , because something that does not exist any longer -- namely , Iraq as a functioning state -- cannot be fixed .
Under the guise of US-inspired constitutional arrangements , the Shia majority has succeeded in arrogating near-absolute power to itself .
Thus , what only a few months ago had looked from Washington like a successful transition to some sort of representative government is obviously a travesty : just as under Saddam , power today grows out of the barrel of the gun -- only now the state does not hold a monopoly on the means of violence .
Every militia , every ministry , every Shia political faction , has its own guns , goons , and death squads -- while the Sunnis continue to use the stockpiles of weapons they accumulated under Saddam to fight a rear-guard action against the new order , apparently legitimized by elections .
There is no power -- save a new violent dictatorship -- that can bring Shi &apos;a , Sunnis , and Kurds to live once again in one body politic .
America &apos;s chimerical dream of democratizing overnight a deeply divided society accustomed only to violence and coercion has unleashed a terrifying array of political demons .
In these circumstances , the post-Baker-Hamilton debate in Washington is largely irrelevant to the future of Iraq -- though it continues to be crucial to the future of US power , prestige , and standing in the world .
The future of Iraq will be decided by the people of Iraq , but with bullets , not ballots .
The US and the entire international community are utterly unequipped to deal with this Middle Eastern version of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences .
And , unlike Yugoslavia &apos;s successor states , which could look to Europe , the lack of a legitimate Arab democratic role model makes crafting a democratic order even more difficult .
Some Europeans and others may gloat over America &apos;s failure in Iraq , and the ineptness -- or worse -- of US post-occupation policy cries to heaven .
Yet the root causes of that failure go deeper , to Iraq &apos;s creation as an artificial entity in the 1920 &apos;s by British imperialist planners , who stitched together three disparate provinces of the defeated Ottoman Empire into a state that never had a coherent identity .
Indeed , the very foundation of Iraq was based on victors &apos; justice : the British Empire , having vanquished the Ottomans , made the Sunni Arabs overlords in a country in which they were a minority .
That arrangement has now come unglued following another cycle of victors &apos; justice .
The consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear .
But a coherent Iraqi state -- whether unitary , federal , or confederal -- will not grow out of a society in which one part of the population views Saddam , rightly , as a gruesome oppressor , while another part reveres him as a hero and martyr .
Wars always have unintended consequences and cruel ironies .
In Iraq , only now is it becoming evident that some states cannot be saved without being destroyed .
The European Union &apos;s Battle for Turkey
When the plotters behind the recent suicide attacks in Istanbul launched their human bombs against Jewish synagogues and British office buildings , they had several audiences in mind .
One audience--and potentially the most important--are the citizens of the European Union , which Turkey &apos;s political class is eager to join as soon as possible .
The battle over Turkish membership in the EU will be fought on many fronts : in the country itself , where the government is currently undertaking major reforms in order to qualify for candidate status ; at the negotiating table once the European Council in December 2004 authorizes the Commission to enter into formal accession talks ; and among the public within the existing member countries .
Of the three fronts , the latter will be the most demanding .
Most EU citizens are uneasy today over the prospect of Turkish membership .
Those responsible for the atrocities in Istanbul may have calculated that Islamic terrorism will increase that uneasiness further .
Traditionally , Europe &apos;s citizens have always accepted the new members that queued up to join the club as it went from the original group of six countries to the 25 that will form the EU in 2004 .
Once a purely West European community , the Union has pushed out its frontiers in all directions .
From next year , it will stretch from the north of Finland to Cyprus and Malta in the south , from Ireland in the west to the Baltic states in the east .
While the people inside have often worried that newcomers would take away their jobs and subsidies , they usually acquiesced in the end .
But Turkey is different .
The 10 new countries that will join next year--and even the Balkan countries that are now being offered the prospect of future membership--are all embraced by a traditional definition of Europe .
None of them is of a size that could upset the EU &apos;s current balance .
Neither applies to Turkey .
Except for a small stretch of land , its territory lies in Asia , not Europe ; its culture is Islamic , not Christian , and if it should join in , say , 2013 , its population will be by far the largest--and youngest--of any EU member .
Moreover , because Turkey borders on such countries as Iran , Iraq and Syria , it will bring to the EU a disturbing neighborhood : a part of the world incapable of developing a regional order on its own , a cockpit of Islamic radicalism and terrorism , a collection of fragile states imbued with nationalism , a field of competition for arms , even nuclear arms , a region where the US will remain strategically involved and where Israel will continue to provide a rallying point for anti-Western sentiments .
With Turkey as a member , the EU will be part of the troubled and troubling wider Middle East , the most challenging region in today &apos;s world .
Yet it is precisely because of these implications that the advantages of having Turkey inside the EU far outweigh the risks .
First and foremost , the prospect of membership is the most powerful force for modernization in Turkey , and a modern , democratic , and prosperous Turkey is of central interest to Europe , whether inside or outside .
Moreover , including within the EU the moderate type of Islam for which Turkey stands will be a major help in integrating Muslim minorities within European countries--already large and growing even without the addition of Turkey &apos;s population .
Finally , with the opportunities that Turkey &apos;s Islamic traditions , regional contacts , resources , and geography provide , the EU will be much better placed to exert a stabilizing influence on a region that will affect Europe &apos;s security in any case .
These are powerful arguments .
The big question is whether they are powerful enough to sway a skeptical European public .
It would take only one country out of perhaps 30 EU members in 2013 to bloc Turkey &apos;s accession .
No doubt some of them will put the matter to a referendum that will leave the decision to the people , not just their parliaments .
Even in Germany , where referenda are not envisaged by the constitution , there are calls to hold one over Turkey &apos;s entry ; one opposition party has already announced that it will make this a central issue in next year &apos;s election campaign for the European Parliament .
Once public unease towards Turkey can find focus in a referendum on the country &apos;s potential EU membership , the chances for it joining look fairly slim .
At the end of the negotiations it may thus come to pass that Turkey is ready for Europe , but Europe is not yet ready for Turkey .
This is why the battle over Turkish membership has already begun , and the bombers of Istanbul seem to have understood this .
Those who believe that the EU is right for both Turkey and Europe must also start to fight for what they profess .
Nothing would be worse--for both Turkey and Europe--than European governments wanting Turkey in but then failing to take their people along .
Terrorists will no doubt continue to instill fear of an Islamic Turkey among Europe &apos;s fainthearted .
Let us hope that in the end , the attacks on innocent people in the crowded streets of Istanbul do not foster European fears , but rather a sense of solidarity with that moderate and dynamic country in the face of a common enemy .
High Fences Make Bad Neighbors in Europe
Good fences make good neighbors , so the poet Robert Frost wrote .
Sadly , the European Union seems to be taking Frost &apos;s poetic whimsy as a serious policy prescription .
For how is the EU preparing to welcome the citizens of the ten countries that will become members in May ?
Simple : by shutting the door in their faces , and then building regulatory walls to keep them away from the door in the first place .
Indeed , the Union is behaving even worse .
Because no agreement exists at the EU level concerning a common set of rules to be applied to the Union &apos;s new citizens , each member country is establishing its own rules without any coordination .
Some of these emerging rules are draconian .
Austria and Germany - so far the two largest recipients of migrants from Eastern Europe , receiving four out of every five - announced last year that they will restrict migration from the new member states for the full transition period of seven years .
France and Belgium will restrict immigration by new EU citizens for at least the first two-years of the transition period .
Sweden initially appeared to take a liberal stance , but is now postponing opening its borders and may tighten migrants &apos; access to welfare benefits .
The Danish government almost collapsed in January when the Ministry of Labor proposed to open the job market to all new EU citizens who can prove that they have found employment .
Greece and Italy have been silent so far , which means that they are likely to keep current restrictions vis-à-vis the new members : they will de facto be treated the same as migrants from outside the EU .
Thus , all the countries bordering the new member states will be closed to migration from the &quot; New Europe . &quot;
All this barrier-building reflects mounting public concern about citizens from the new member states emigrating to take advantage of generous welfare systems in the Union .
Little wonder , then , that the largest drops in popular support for enlargement registered by the Eurobarometer Survey occurred in EU countries with the most generous welfare states .
But support for enlargement is fading everywhere , right on the brink of accession .
At the same time , closing the doors to the Union &apos;s newest citizens will not solve the problem of welfare access and will certainly hurt economic growth .
In EU labor markets characterized by low mobility , such as those that exist across Western and Southern Europe , migrants can play a very important role .
By increasing average productivity , they contribute not only to stronger growth , but also to achieving higher incomes per capita .
In fact , due to distortions in how wages are set-often set irrespective of local labor productivity rates-migrants can even contribute to reducing unemployment in Western and Southern Europe .
Moreover , shutting the door will not solve the problem of welfare access , because illegal migration is worse than legal migration : it draws resources without contributing anything to finance the welfare state even though most migrants are young and do work .
A better way to deal with the fear of migrants abusing social welfare systems would be to adopt a common and rather generous transitional quota at the level of the EU as a whole , to be lifted early if it is not filled .
Migration quotas should be preferred to other types of restrictions on the ground that they allow at least a part of the potential welfare gains from migration to be realized .
Quotas could be established at levels set on the basis of past periods of high migration - say , an annual flow of 400,000 people to the EU .
While these transitional restrictions are put in place , reforms should be undertaken that address the underlying basis for the public &apos;s fear of migration .
The root of this fear , of course , is the vast differences in income between citizens of , say , Lithuania , and those of most of the Union .
Of course , economic convergence is a long-term business .
Thus , redistributive policies in the EU should be reformed in ways that discourage &quot; welfare shopping &quot; by citizens of its poorest member states .
Here the problem is the incompatibility of insurance schemes , on the one hand , in which the benefits that people receive are based on what they have contributed , and , on the other hand , social assistance programs that entail cash transfers .
All EU countries , including the new members , should be encouraged to adapt social assistance schemes ( which also exist in the new member states ) so as to meet some basic income requirements .
EU-wide coordination of these minimum guaranteed income schemes should be gradually pursued , with the long-term intention of building up a pan-European safety net as one of the institutional pillars of the EU .
Calderon &apos;s Cauldron
Under dramatically inauspicious circumstances , Mexico has finally got itself a new president last Friday .
Felipe Calderón has taken the oath of office , braving the wrath of his left-wing opposition , out-smarting the Partido de la Revolución Democrática ( PRD ) and its leader , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , but nonetheless paying a high price .
Every TV news show and front-page headline in the world ran the same headline : &quot; New Mexican President inaugurated in chaos and fisticuffs . &quot;
Mexico &apos;s institutions withstood -- just barely -- the onslaught of a virtually insurrectional left-wing opposition , bent in vain on stopping Calderón &apos;s inauguration , and of a resentful Partido Revolucionario Institucional ( PRI ) , increasingly dedicated to allowing Calderón to take office , and then fail miserably .
Calderón impressively overcame apparently insurmountable obstacles on the way to the presidency , yet the struggle to govern and transform Mexico has just begun .
Most Mexican commentators believe that it should be relatively easy for Calderón to improve on the largely self-inflicted failure of outgoing President Vicente Fox &apos;s term .
Mexico needs to grow at roughly twice the rate that it did under Fox ( a meager 2 % per year ) .
If Calderón can strengthen law and order , and use his considerable political skills to reach agreement with the PRI on structural economic reforms , he will succeed .
But this view is simplistic .
Fox &apos;s term , along with the four last years of former President Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s mandate , were hardly a failure .
Not since the 1960 &apos;s had Mexico undergone ten consecutive years of economic stability , low inflation , low interest rates , a stable currency , and constant , though mediocre growth .
For the first time ever , mortgages , automobile loans , and consumer credit became available to the lower middle class : this year more homes were built and sold , and more cars were bought , than ever before .
Likewise , while Fox can be criticized for not clamping down on protesters and a disruptive , extremist opposition , he never resorted to the bloody repression for which most of his predecessors came to be known .
Moreover , he dragged Mexico out of its archaic foreign policy cocoon , and placed immigration and human rights at the heart of Mexico &apos;s new international agenda .
Nor is Calderón finding it easy to negotiate with the PRI , failing to build a coalition government , which he has repeatedly proclaimed as the solution to the gridlock that has cursed Mexico since 1997 .
Whatever the advantages of a cabinet comprising solely members of his Partido Acción Nacional ( PAN ) , this is not what Calderón sought .
Similarly , no deal with the opposition was possible regarding the inauguration ceremony -- thus the chaotic , depressing scenes of congressmen fighting it out in their chamber , while Calderón was ushered in through the back door for a rushed ceremony .
Mexico &apos;s economic problems might be similarly more intractable than many commentators seem to believe .
Mexico experienced a &quot; cold-turkey &quot; economic opening under former President Carlos Salinas in 1988-1994 ; a belated but successful political opening under former President Zedillo in 1994-2000 ; and , at long last , a true rotation in power thanks to Fox .
But the foundations of the old PRI-corporativist system created in the 1930 &apos;s remain untouched , and represent the main and most formidable obstacles to Mexico &apos;s growth and success .
The first pillar of this system is the public and private economic monopolies that dominate the country .
The state-owned oil ( Pemex ) and electric power ( Federal Electricity Commission ) companies face no competition .
The private virtual monopolies in telecommunications ( Telmex ) , television ( Televisa ) , cement ( Cemex ) , bread and tortilla manufacturing ( Bimbo and Maseca , respectively ) , banking ( Banamex / Citigroup and Bancomer / Banco de Bilbao ) may face competition abroad , but not at home .
These monopolies are stronger than ever , and prices , supply , service , and quality all suffer .
The second pillar is formed by the unions that have controlled the Mexican labor movement since the 1930 &apos;s .
They enjoy &quot; closed shop &quot; hiring and firing prerogatives , leadership elections by acclamation , mandatory dues without transparency , and immense political power .
The teachers &apos; union is the largest in Latin America , the oil workers &apos; union is the richest in Latin America , and the social security employees union has thwarted any attempt at pension or health reform for years .
The third pillar of the system is political monopoly .
For 70 years , the PRI had a complete lock on Mexican politics ; now three parties do , and no one else can enter the political arena or gain access to the enormous public subsidies -- more than $ 500 million last year -- handed out to these parties without their consent .
The main parties write their own anti-trust legislation , vote their own subsidies , and choose their own elected officials .
The absence of consecutive re-election at any level reinforces the party machines &apos; power : they pick candidates , whom voters merely ratify at the polls .
So Mexico &apos;s challenges boil down to liberating the labor movement , breaking up the private monopolies and opening the public monopolies to competition , and lowering entry barriers that restrict access to the political arena .
These may not be sufficient conditions for success , but they are certainly necessary ones .
Calderón must strengthen his presidency from the outset .
Taking on the powers that be is perhaps the only way to achieve this , however risky it might appear .
Elected with only 35 % of the vote , lacking a majority in Congress , and taking office on the eve of an economic slowdown in the United States , things would be difficult anyway .
Given that roughly a third of the electorate does not think he won fairly , and in view of the precariousness of the rule of law in the country , Calderón &apos;s position is even less enviable .
Caution and patience might not be his best advisors .
The Chávez Challenge
Venezuela &apos;s recent legislative elections confirmed trends that have repeatedly brought the country into the headlines in recent years .
President Hugo Chávez showed once again that he enjoys broad support among the nation &apos;s poor and desperate , and that he is miles ahead of his opposition in terms of political skill , cunning , and ruthlessness .
Yet at the same time voter turnout is declining with each passing election under Chávez , and the questionable fairness of the electoral process has grown increasingly apparent .
To be sure , the opposition &apos;s withdrawal from the election just days before the vote was , as Chávez claimed , more a symptom of its own weakness than of problems with the electoral process .
And , just as surely , that very weakness is a function of the gradual stifling of many features of Venezuela &apos;s traditional democratic order .
Even so , the opposition &apos;s mistakes have been massive , ranging from support for the failed coup against the democratically elected Chávez in April 2002 to the failed strike at PEDEVSA , Venezuela &apos;s national oil company , in early 2003 .
Nothing is more lethal in politics than failure in direct confrontation .
In such circumstances , Chávez can afford to be bold , despite his policies &apos; failure to benefit his core constituency : the more than 50 % of Venezuelans who live in destitution and despair .
Poverty has grown since Chávez took office in 1998 ; government finances and the trade balance are more dependent on oil revenues than before , and , aside from Cuban literacy programs and neighborhood &quot; barefoot doctor &quot; services , the overall welfare of the poor remains the same , if not worse .
Major changes are unlikely in the foreseeable future .
Chávez will be able to modify the Constitution largely as he pleases , and pack both the justice system and the electoral authority with his placemen .
He will continue to dole out oil-based subsidies in the well-worn Venezuelan tradition of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Carlos Andrés Pérez .
As a result , Chávez will be re-elected late next year , and he may well remain in power until the end of the next decade .
Yet , if this is what the Venezuelan people want , then so be it .
It is , after all , their business who governs them , and how , as long as human rights are not systematically violated , democratic institutions are not indefinitely suspended , and standard norms of international conduct are respects .
Judged by the last standard , at least , Chávez may have crossed the line .
For years , he has been accused of taking over where Fidel Castro left off : supporting the rhetoric of radicalism and anti-imperialism , if not revolution , throughout Latin America .
It could now be time for other Latin American nations and the international community to take such charges more seriously .
Chávez is giving away oil to Caribbean island nations and Cuba , and buying off Argentine debt to help President Nestor Kirchner &apos;s political fortunes .
In Mar del Plata , Argentina , last month , he openly participated in a rally against the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) , in the company of , among others , Evo Morales , the coca-leaf growers &apos; leader from Bolivia who might well become that country &apos;s next president .
Similarly , Chávez is clearly supporting Daniel Ortega , the perennial Sandinista presidential candidate in Nicaragua , and Shafick Handal , the equally perennial FMLN candidate in El Salvador .
His former ambassador to Mexico participated openly and vociferously in campaign events for Mexico City Mayor Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador &apos;s presidential campaign .
There seems to be a common thread to most of Chávez &apos;s foreign policy : to provoke a major confrontation with the United States .
The danger , of course , is that if and when confrontation comes -- over Bolivia , the FTAA , human rights , or press freedoms -- it will be too late to defuse it .
The challenge , then , lies in avoiding a confrontation that Chávez clearly wants .
Unfortunately , George W. Bush &apos;s administration has not proved particularly adept at conflict prevention .
The hemisphere &apos;s other nations have a direct stake in attempting to pre-empt a fight that would force them to take sides and might threaten their economic and national-security interests .
Although many of Chávez &apos;s positions have found support in certain Latin American nations , the division that he and Castro &apos;s Cuba have created in Latin America -- between left and right , free-traders and &quot; Bolivarians , &quot; and pro- and anti- Americans -- is mainly artificial and certainly not impossible to overcome .
To be sure , many Latin American leaders have tried to assuage and control Chávez , and they have all failed .
But the cost of not trying again could be extremely high .
The last time revolutionary leaders confronted the US head-on , in Central America during the 1980 &apos;s , everyone lost .
A new split up and down the hemisphere , engineered by a leader awash in oil money , would prove far more disastrous .
Should We Affirm Affirmative Action ?
Equal rights for all citizens are fundamental to a liberal order .
Such rights offer opportunities for political participation , to form associations , and to speak one &apos;s mind .
But they also open doors to economic participation , and doors to participation in social institutions like education .
Constitutional guarantees of these rights are the great achievement of the long battle for citizenship that marked the last two centuries .
However , such legal guarantees of rights are often insufficient .
Even the right to vote means little for someone who is totally dependent on other people or institutions .
Equality before the law remains an empty promise for those who cannot afford to make use of it or simply do not know how to do so .
The civil right to an education according to talent requires encouragement of many kinds .
Thus , one great theme of social progress in the last century was to imbue the abstract concept of equal rights with social substance .
This meant active encouragement by information , by political education , for example .
As far as education was concerned , it often meant committing resources to financial assistance for students , such as subsidized loans or scholarships .
Yet when all this was done , certain stubborn obstacles to equal participation remained .
Major groups remained underrepresented among societies &apos; most successful citizens .
This was notably the case for women and for some cultural minorities , especially if these were defined by unchosen &quot; ascriptive &quot; characteristics , such as skin color .
Few people from these groups were found among senior managers , government ministers , professors , doctors , and lawyers , so that the suspicion grew that there are largely invisible barriers blocking access to such positions .
Perhaps entrenched institutional cultures militated against women or black people .
Wanting real citizenship for all meant that more had to be done than offering legal guarantees , information , or even financial support .
It was a courageous step , first taken in the United States , to decide that at least for a while a new kind of policy was needed to remedy long-term injustices . Affirmative action , as it was called , consisted of rules that set aside a certain percentage of representation among candidates for office , students and teachers , police and the military , and in other walks of life to members of hitherto disadvantaged groups .
The US Supreme Court became the guardian of affirmative action .
Wherever it was seriously tried , affirmative action undoubtedly had some success .
This is notably the case in countries that were once homogeneous but now have to deal with citizens who are black or Muslim or are otherwise in an identifiable and neglected minority position .
But at the very moment that other countries were looking to America for a policy model , affirmative action began to raise questions , of which three are particularly important .
First , is there not a risk of a kind of inverted injustice by which the traditionally privileged become the new underprivileged ?
The US Supreme Court confronted this question when it first dealt with the case of a white student who was not admitted to medical school despite having better academic qualifications than other applicants .
In Britain , children in private schools must now fear to be at a disadvantage because of the pressure on universities to admit more students from state schools .
This takes us back to the old and vexing question : can we be equal and excellent too ?
Second , is equal representation at all levels really what all groups want or need ?
After all , the &quot; feminization &quot; of the teaching profession in many countries has not done any harm .
Many countries have benefited from the entrepreneurialism of their Chinese or Jewish minorities .
Are we perhaps pursuing too mechanical an ideal which confuses the absence of privilege and disadvantage with the absence of diversity ?
Third , is affirmative action in some cases producing a new kind of rigid segmentation that destroys the very civil society it was intended to create ?
Are women , for example , always the best defenders of women &apos;s interests ?
The same question can be raised for members of religious groups and ethnic minorities , or even of certain social classes .
One shudders to think of parliaments in which the main criterion of membership is to belong to a group in need of affirmative action .
Indeed , in some countries , democracy fails to deliver imaginative and effective governance because the main objective seems to be to have all major groups on board .
To repeat the earlier point : affirmative action was and is a courageous final step in the fight for universal citizenship rights - not just on paper , but in reality .
But affirmative action must not become an enduring principle of a liberal order .
If any set of rules needs a &quot; sunset clause &quot; to enforce review after a specific and limited period , it is affirmative action .
The flexibility of the US Supreme Court in this regard is admirable .
Elsewhere it is probably best to include in the laws of countries and the statutes of organizations a clause that makes affirmative action lapse after five years , or at most ten .
Such a clause could be renewed , but there is nothing so effective as a firm deadline to force a thorough review and concentrate minds .
The Nation State Revisited
It has become fashionable to claim that the nation state has lost its place .
Globalization , it is said , means that nations can no longer control their own affairs .
They must join with others , as in the European Union or ASEAN or Mercosur , and they must increasingly rely on global institutions like the United Nations , the World Bank , and the World Trade Organization .
But such a view is risky .
Indeed , on closer inspection , it proves to be dubious , when not simply wrong .
The nation state , with both its strengths and weaknesses , is alive and well .
To begin with its strengths , the nation state remains the only political space in which the constitution of liberty thrives .
The democratic credentials of organizations like the EU are doubtful , and entirely absent in the case of the UN and other world institutions .
Moreover , despite the frequent search for new identities , European or Latin American or otherwise , and despite many references to a new cosmopolitanism , or even a &quot; world civil society , &quot; most people feel at home in their own country -- the nation state of which they are citizens .
Migration is generally migration to other countries .
Many countries are currently debating the integration of migrants .
What does it take to be British or German or American ?
Such debates about immigration make sense only if we recognize that citizenship is defined by and for nations .
This is , for most people , the positive side of the nation state .
The nation state has been , and continues to be , the relevant unit of belonging and civic involvement for most human beings for more than two centuries .
It is the context in which we find our liberties safeguarded or destroyed .
Certainly , the countries freed from communism in 1989 felt that restoring national sovereignty and recovering liberty were bound together .
Yet there is , and always has been , another , uglier face of the nation state : nationalism .
The nationalist impulse can be aggressive or defensive , directed against others or inward-looking .
Either way , it vitiates all attempts to create an international community of open societies .
This was the problem in Iraq : a nation state had become a disturber of peace in the region and beyond .
More recently , a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon has gained ground , the revival of national protectionism .
The Doha Round of trade negotiations is stalled because developed countries do not want to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries , which in turn try to protect what nascent industries they have .
Many would prefer privileged relationships to open trade .
In this regard , the EU has often obliged .
But now the nationalist bug has infected the EU itself .
France , Spain , and Poland have attempted to keep major industries firmly in &quot; national hands . &quot;
Suddenly , the single European market is forgotten , and a return to fragmented markets is taking root .
Consider , for example , the European Commission &apos;s so-called &quot; services directive . &quot;
Although freedom of movement for labor is one of the single market &apos;s &quot; four freedoms , &quot; many EU countries are trying to protect their domestic labor markets by suspending this freedom for as long as possible .
Germany , in particular , argues that the high unemployment resulting from reunification in 1990 requires it to close its labor market to the new member states to its east .
Such trends are dangerous .
Historically , protectionism has often led to economic conflict , which can rapidly turn into more serious clashes .
The signs are not good , even in Europe .
A recent summit of EU leaders addressed energy policy -- one area where cooperation is not only highly desirable , but necessary .
Yet even German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- clearly a pro-European -- went to the meeting with the explicit intention of barring the creation of other European powers in this field .
The German-Russian agreement to build a gas pipeline bypassing Poland and Lithuania , with former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder leading the effort , has already harmed Polish-German relations , to say nothing of European cooperation .
For a time , the pendulum of political opinion may have swung too far against the nation state and its role .
This is one reason why so many people have felt estranged from their political leaders .
But it would be unfortunate -- indeed , dangerous -- if the pendulum now swung back to old-fashioned nationalism .
Nation states are welcome ; they are important elements of a liberal world order .
But they have to be open to cooperation and coordination with others .
We must be vigilant in resisting the start of a trend reminiscent of developments in the early years of the twentieth century ­ ­ -- a trend that quickly led to global disaster .
Is Gordon Brown Electable ?
Gordon Brown obviously wants to succeed Tony Blair as British prime minister .
But it is less obvious that he is willing to do what is necessary to lead the Labour Party to victory in the next general election .
In some critical sense , he must repudiate Blair &apos;s legacy , which , at a minimum , means promising to take Britain out of the Iraq War .
Brown has longed to be prime minister ever since May 12 , 1994 , the fateful day when John Smith , the Labour Party &apos;s leader in opposition , dropped dead of a heart attack .
Two weeks later , on May 31 , Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London , and debated who should take over the party leadership .
By the end of their discussion , they had made a double deal : Brown would stand aside and support Blair as the next party leader ; in return , Blair would later give up the leadership to him .
Crucially , but inevitably , they did not agree when , or under what circumstances , Blair would fulfil his side of the bargain .
Inevitably , they could not foresee that Blair would go on to win an unprecedented three successive election victories for Labour , in 1997 , 2001 , and 2005 , and thus keep Labour in power for a record-breaking period of possibly as long as 13 years .
The key challenge for New Labour ( as Blair re-styled it with his characteristic gift for spin ) , was the management of the British economy .
Since World War II , most British governments tried to manipulate the economy for short-term party advantage , usually with disastrous long-term results .
This lamentable tradition was common to both Conservatives and Labour ; and yet , unfairly , it was the Labour Party that was most contaminated by the smear that it could not be trusted to manage the economy .
Brown decisively changed that reputation .
He has been probably the most outstanding Chancellor of the Exchequer in British history , not because of any inspiration or genius , but simply because he has built on a new tradition of prioritizing low inflation , low interest rates , and stable government finances .
Brown understood that these priorities were essential , not just for the British economy , but also for the long-term prospects of Labour in power ; and he entrenched this agenda by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility for keeping inflation low .
As a result , Britain has had an unprecedented decade of low inflation and relatively high economic growth , outperforming many of its European counterparts .
Yet , despite economic success , it became steadily clearer that Blair &apos;s time was running out .
The electorate grew increasingly disillusioned with the unavoidable shortcomings of an over-familiar government , and the party grew increasingly discontented with a leader who had outstayed his welcome .
At first , Blair thought that he could claim the right to remain in power for a third full five-year term .
But the pressure on him to go has steadily risen , to the point where he has now almost promised to give up in the summer of 2007 .
But no one knows exactly when , or how , Blair will step down .
If there is a formal leadership contest , it seems likely that several rival candidates will aim to stand .
But almost all authoritative observers seem to agree that Brown is by far the most likely man to be the next Labour prime minister .
That is the easy part .
From that point on , no one seems certain whether Brown knows what to do , or has what it takes , to fight and win another general election for Labour .
His reputation for command and control of the economy is magisterial and unchallenged , but he has given almost no clue as to what he thinks of other government policies .
He has remained dour and almost silent , visibly chafing with impatience to come into his inheritance , but offering no hint of what difference he would make when he does .
The one thing he cannot do is promises to continue Blair &apos;s policies .
If Brown offers more of the same , he will lose .
After ten years of Blair , he must offer one or more policies that mark a clear break .
The most obvious candidate for such a policy switch is Iraq : if Brown wants to win an election as Labour leader , he must renounce Blair &apos;s policy and announce the withdrawal , in short order , of British troops .
In tactical terms , this should be easy and obvious : whatever the deceitful and illegal reasons originally given for invading Iraq , everyone now knows that this war has proved a political , strategic , and moral catastrophe .
Everyone knows that it cannot be &quot; won , &quot; whatever that means , and Brown knows that both the war and Britain &apos;s servile subordination to the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in Britain .
This is the issue that is crying out to be addressed : but so far none of the main political parties has dared touch it .
In the past three weeks , Labour , the Liberal Democrats , and the Conservatives have all held their annual conferences .
All of them concentrated on domestic policies ; none dared discuss Iraq , because they all know that to do so would raise the question of withdrawal , which in turn would unleash a major and possibly explosive debate about Britain &apos;s relationship with the US .
Does Brown have the stomach to take on the risks involved in confronting the Iraq question ?
Possibly not .
He may decide that it is too difficult , in which case he will be a lame duck prime minister , condemned to serve out the three years remaining in Labour &apos;s current term with no hope of winning the next election .
That is not what he planned when he struck his bargain with Blair back in 1994 .
The New New Thing in Economics
The Great Depression brought John Maynard Keynes to the forefront of economic thought .
The key &quot; Keynesian &quot; insight was that private investment spending is inherently unstable--due to fads and fashions among investors , or because of shifts in the &quot; animal spirits &quot; of businessmen , or because falling prices disrupt the financial system .
Keynesians thought that prudent monetary policy--central banks raising and lowering interest rates to diminish fluctuations in private investment spending--could go part of the way toward stabilizing the economy .
But they also believed that government had to be willing to step in directly , through expansive fiscal policy , to keep the overall level of spending in an economy stable .
Such a policy , they believed , would forever banish the specter of large-scale mass unemployment , as in the Great Depression .
Moreover , near-full employment might effectively be guaranteed .
The Keynesians foresaw that near-full employment raised the threat of inflation .
After all , why should workers and unions moderate wage demands if governments will boost spending whenever high unemployment looms ?
One big curb on high wage demands--fear of being let go when unemployment rises--was gone .
What would replace it ?
For the first post-1945 generation , the predominant answer was that corporatist social democracy would replace it .
Unions would bow to government requests to moderate their demands for wage increases , and governments would bow to union demands for public spending and social insurance .
Keynesian thinking guaranteed that nothing like the Great Depression would ever return .
But its solution to the problem of creeping inflation was jury-rigged , and broke down completely in the 1970 &apos;s .
In the aftermath of the main industrial countries &apos; burst of inflation in the 1970 &apos;s , mainstream economic thought in the world &apos;s industrial core shifted into a &quot; semi-Monetarist &quot; channel .
Milton Friedman &apos;s victory was never as complete as the Keynesians &apos; had been .
But by the mid-1980 &apos;s policymakers throughout the world were assenting to the following propositions :
Central banks must make their commitments to long-run price stability credible ;
Central banks must accept that the average level of unemployment is determined not by cyclical factors , but by &quot; structural &quot; factors , which they have no business trying to address ;
Announcing and trying to maintain a money-supply growth target is an easy way for a central bank to communicate its principal intentions , gain credibility , and give outsiders a way to check whether sound policies are really being followed .
Monetarism was the mirror image of Keynesianism .
It seemingly guaranteed that nothing like the inflation of the 1970 &apos;s would ever return .
But it offered no solution to the problem of structural unemployment that arose in western Europe .
The past decade and a half demonstrated that monetarism is as ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of falling prices in the context of highly-leveraged firms and banks as the Keynesian prescription was ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of inflation .
Back in the 1970 &apos;s and at the start of the 1980 &apos;s , many ( I was one ) blamed bad decisions for the breakdown of the social-democratic systems &apos; ability to control inflation .
Politicians did not understand that expanding social insurance was the inevitable price of wage restraint , while union leaders did not understand that if corporatist social democracy did not restrain inflation , political power would shift to the right and high unemployment would be used to restrain it .
Today , many blame today &apos;s alarming economic conditions in the world &apos;s industrial core--more than a decade of stagnation in Japan , deflation there and in Germany , recession in Germany--on other bad decisions .
Japanese and European central bankers did not lower interest rates far enough fast enough , banking-sector regulators shied at the jump in speculative lending , and politicians were unwilling to expand fiscal policy sufficiently .
But politicians and central bank governors cannot always be expected to make good decisions : good policies must be designed to function even when rulers are short-sighted and badly advised .
The inflation of the 1970 &apos;s was a natural failure of Keynesian political economy .
The deflation that threatens Japan , Europe , and perhaps the US with the prospect of a long period of large gaps between potential and actual output is a natural failure of the semi-Monetarist orthodoxy that governed macroeconomic policy in the world &apos;s industrial core since the early 1980 &apos;s .
Round and round we go .
But it &apos;s not quite a circle : no government would allow a repeat of the liquidity collapse seen in the 1930 &apos;s , or the failure of banks and companies on a scale that puts the entire financial system at hazard .
It is an upward spiral .
The world &apos;s macroeconomic problems are real , but they will not lead to another Great Depression--in large part because policymakers remember that there once was a Great Depression .
We need another policy-making revolution like the Keynesian and semi-Monetarist ones , a revolution that will not ( wholly ) lose sight of its predecessor &apos;s achievements , but will eliminate its natural failures .
Where might that revolution come from ?
Perhaps the next revolution in economics will grow out of US Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke &apos;s career-long concern with asset prices , the role of adverse selection in credit markets , and the need for central banks in difficult situations to do more than conduct short-term open-market operations .
He believes that banks should try things like putting a floor beneath key long-term bond prices .
Bernankeism , anyone ?
Man &apos;s Fate / Man &apos;s Hope
For quite a while now — certainly since the terrorist attacks on the US of September 11 , 2001 , and before as we watched the slaughters in Kosovo , Sarajevo , Srebrenica , Rwanda , and Congo on our televisions — the news has been dominated by war and rumors of war , by violent death and threats of violent death .
Everyone , everywhere is keenly aware of the power of our weapons .
From nuclear-tipped missiles down to trucks full of fertilizer or explosives worn as belts , we have used our technology to amplify greatly the dark parts of our nature as a violent — and not even a properly predatory — species .
I certainly do not want to downplay or dismiss this side of humanity &apos;s history and our current events .
I do not want anyone to forget that over less than half of the years contained in the past century — from the outbreak of World War I to the famine that followed Mao &apos;s &quot; Great Leap Forward &quot; — about one in every ten people alive on this planet was shot , gassed , stabbed , burned , or starved to death by his or her fellow human beings .
But that is not the whole story .
Indeed , the human abattoirs of the twentieth century — and even the slaughterhouses that various humans are preparing now — may not appear from the perspective of the future to be the most important part of our experience and condition , and of what our descendants will regard as their history .
For them , the most important features of what our experience may instead be :
·

For most of the twentieth century , large chunks of the world remained desperately poor for one or more of four related reasons : ( 1 ) criminal misgovernment ; ( 2 ) lack of the machines to do anything useful and productive in the world economy besides subsistence agriculture and unskilled service work ; ( 3 ) lack of the public education system needed to give people the literacy and the skills to operate the machines ; and ( 4 ) barriers ( legal and physical ) that kept people where demand was low from selling the products of their work where demand was high .
But over the course of the late twentieth century , these four causes of desperate poverty have largely fallen away .
Governments as bad as Kim Jong-Il &apos;s in North Korea are now extremely rare .
Nearly all countries in the world are at most one generation away from near-universal literacy .
The fast pace of technological progress has created a cornucopia of invention and innovation that is open to every place that can send someone away to get a master &apos;s degree in engineering .
Most important , the barriers to making goods and services in Mauritius , Mozambique , or Mauritania and selling them in New York or Berlin , Santiago or Tokyo are dropping swiftly .
The gargantuan container ships that first appeared a generation ago brought one revolution to world trade .
The use of information technology to manage transportation and distribution channels is likely to have a similarly profound effect .
Moreover , the advent of the Internet and the fiber-optic cable will do as much to make service-sector work internationally tradable as the coming of the iron-hulled steamship a century and a half ago did to make bulk agricultural products and manufactures internationally tradable .
It will take at least a generation for these changes to make themselves felt in most corners of the world .
But inside the industrial core of the world &apos;s rich countries there is already concern about these looming revolutions .
Indeed , this concern will only become sharper and stronger , as citizens in rich countries fear that as the remaining barriers to international trade fall , industrial-core income distributions , social orders , and politics will be shaken to their foundations .
For the world as a whole , however , the next two generations are ones that will bring an extraordinary opportunity for economic growth and world prosperity .
Perhaps at the end of history there is a pot of gold , after all .
Neo-liberalism &apos;s Argentine Failure
In the 1990s Argentina implemented perhaps 80 % of the neoliberal economic policy agenda .
It opened up its economy to world trade and international capital ; it sought to guarantee low inflation and sound money .
It strove to improve its legal system so that decisions would accord with general rules and foster confidence that contracts would be enforced--whether or not a bribe had been paid .
It failed .
This is not to say that the 1990s , even with their aftermath leading into the terrible summer of 2002 , were catastrophic .
Life was clearly worse during the Dirty War of the 1970s , when an army with no honor threw women out of helicopters into the South Atlantic , and urban guerrillas shot people because ... because ... well , just because !
The 1980s were hardly better .
Starting with a full-fledged debt crisis triggered by a massive rise in both US interest rates and the value of the American dollar , the decade ended with domestically-generated hyperinflation , causing Argentina to fall a decade further behind the world &apos;s leading economies .
In the 1990s , by contrast , Argentina &apos;s GDP per capita grow by 25 % from trough to peak--only to lose this entire income gain over the past four years .
Until late last winter , Argentina &apos;s problems seemed merely an unpleasant but temporary bump , in the same way that the 1994-1995 Mexican &quot; tequila &quot; crisis or the East Asian crises of 1997-1998 proved to be only temporary interruptions , not watersheds .
Such optimism is impossible today , and there is little hope that the country &apos;s recent meltdown is only temporary .
The establishment view--say , in US Treasury Undersecretary John Taylor &apos;s office--is that Argentina &apos;s collapse is the fault of its politicians .
I half-agree with this view .
Argentine leaders were repeatedly warned that keeping the exchange rate constant and fixing the peso &apos;s value against the US dollar risked sending the economy into recession if the dollar gained value .
Argentine politicians were also warned that their peso policy could not be sustained unless the ratio of national debt to GDP was falling .
Yet during the boom years of 1993-1998 , public spending outran taxes enough to push Argentina &apos;s debt-to-GDP ratio from 29 to 44 % .
When the dollar appreciated and recession came , politicians with too little statesmanship to balance the budget in good times turned out to have too little courage to balance the budget when times turned hard .
The coup de grâce was delivered by the government &apos;s decision ( when the crisis came ) to keep bank deposits fixed in dollars and to change debts owed to banks into pesos , thereby bankrupting the country &apos;s financial system with a single stroke of the pen .
The establishment position is that if any of these three disastrous policies had not been implemented , Argentina would not have fallen into crisis , or at worst it would have suffered a small tequila-style crisis .
Argentina &apos;s 1990 &apos;s neo-liberal program was nearly idiot-proof , according to this view , but Argentine politicians turned out to form a large and ingenious class of idiots .
There is , however , another way of looking at the Argentine tragedy .
It is based on the observation that the country &apos;s political system has long performed in a predictable way , consistently producing governments that promise more than they can deliver .
They promise rich oligarchs that they will not collect much in taxes .
They promise workers and consumers generous social insurance .
They promise rapid economic development , generous infrastructure spending , cushy low-work jobs for the politically connected , and so forth .
Taken together , these promises mean that claims on national product always exceed 100 % of the total .
Popular demands that the government fulfills all of them cannot possibly be met .
Add to this an unfair distribution of income and wealth , lack of social comity between the working and middle classes , and a long tradition of political violence , and you have the recipe for a politics of all-against-all .
The basic political fight about how wealth should be distributed in Argentina remains unresolved .
Any political force that tries to curb the bidding by promising only what it can deliver is doomed to defeat .
So in Argentina big government deficits are a law of nature , a fact of life .
Hence Argentine interest rates can be low and affordable only for rare , short periods .
Everyone knew that Argentina &apos;s political system generates chronic deficits , and this meant that interest payments on the debt were likely to explode .
Because the dynamics of Argentine debt were so unstable , a hard-currency exchange-rate peg could not last .
Free access to international capital markets and dollar-denominated bank accounts meant that when the exchange-rate peg finally collided with the deficit-producing logic of Argentine politics , the result could be nothing short of catastrophic .
Had today &apos;s crisis been finessed , had Argentina another decade of rapid growth , its conflicts over wealth distribution might have moderated .
After all , Europe before WWII possessed the nastiest politics on earth : rioting right-wing mobs in France , general strikes in Britain , civil war in Spain , fascism in Italy , and the Nazis &apos; vicious consolidation of power in Germany .
Yet postwar Western Europe encountered no public problems that could not be resolved in ways that preserved sound money and growth .
I half-agree with this view , too .
Yes , Argentina &apos;s government made huge mistakes ; its politicians sinned against the gods of monetary economics .
But did the punishment need to be so swift and so severe ?
The False Promise of Private Pensions
One of the strangest claims made in the debates about social insurance now roiling the world &apos;s richest countries is the that government-funded defined-benefit pension programs ( such as America &apos;s Social Security system ) are outmoded .
These programs were fine , the argument goes , for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the post-World War II generation , but they have become obsolete in today &apos;s high-tech , networked , post-industrial economy .
Advocates of this argument propose a different model .
Just as corporations today are much happier supporting workers &apos; pensions by contributing to employees &apos; private accounts , so governments today should offer ( or require ) contributions to privately owned accounts .
The value of these accounts would fluctuate with the market rather than resting on a defined-benefit scheme that guarantees a fixed real sum of resources available upon retirement .
This argument is strange because it gets the economics of the situation backward .
When there are lots of companies offering workers long-term defined-benefit retirement pensions , there are fewer advantages to the government in setting up a parallel defined-benefit scheme and requiring workers to participate in it .
After all , in such a world , workers who set great value on a defined-benefit pension can go to work for firms that offer such pensions .
The major benefits that arise from the government &apos;s requiring that workers also participate in a national Social Security system accrue to those workers who really ought to value a defined-benefit pension highly but have not been able to figure out what their true preferences are .
They also accrue to relatively poor workers who lack the bargaining power to induce bosses to offer the pensions they really want -- and need .
But there aren &apos;t a lot of companies today that are willing to offer long-term defined-benefit pension schemes .
One reason is that companies nowadays are much more aware of their own long-run fragility than they were in the post-World War II decades .
Not even America &apos;s IBM -- which prides itself on stability -- wants to take the risk of offering defined-benefit schemes .
The risk from defined-benefit pensions used to be offset by two benefits for companies that offered them .
First , the fact that leaving the company usually meant cashing in one &apos;s pension at a discount increased worker loyalty .
Second , complaisant accountants &apos; optimistic assumptions about returns on pension reserves , together with large firms &apos; greater risk-bearing capacity , brightened the financial picture that companies could report to investors .
Today , the risks are seen to be much greater , and the benefits are seen to be less .
As a result , an ever-smaller slice of employers are offering anything like defined-benefit pensions .
This fall-off in private defined-benefit pensions all across the rich core of the world economy is a bad thing , because the configuration of asset prices suggests that young and middle-aged workers value defined-benefit pensions extremely highly .
Historically , the gap between expected returns on low-risk assets like government or investment-grade bonds and high-risk assets like stocks and real estate has been very high .
To some degree , as economists like Harvard &apos;s Robert Barro and mathematicians like Benoit Mandelbrot argue , this may be because high-risk investments are in reality much more risky than the theories and math of standard finance techniques suggest .
In my opinion , at least , this is partly because the memory of years like 1930 and 2000 , when stocks performed very badly , occupies too large a place in investors &apos; minds .
Workers and other asset holders place a very high value on safety , security , and predictability , so a defined-benefit pension plan is extremely valuable .
But in today &apos;s world , only national governments are large enough to be able to do so with any assurance that the pension assets will actually be there when workers retire .
I am enough of a social democrat to believe that if there is an economic service or benefit that citizens value extremely highly and that only the government can provide , then the government should provide it .
We economists know that there are many drawbacks to expanding government beyond its basic role of providing true public goods like defense , public safety , and justice , as well as providing citizens with incentives to counterbalance the effects of true market failures .
If the private market has the flexibility of two hands , government bureaucracy has at best two thumbs .
But the collection of payroll taxes from tens of millions of workers and the writing of tens of millions of pension checks is the kind of routine , semi-automatic task that government can do well .
With private companies backing away from defined-benefit programs , it is even more important and valuable that government do it in our post-industrial network-age society than it was in the past .
The Islamic Democratic Paradox
The rage across the Arab world over the publication in Denmark ( months ago ) of cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed , together with the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of Iran &apos;s politics , has made &quot; political Islam &quot; a fundamental question of international diplomacy .
But a one-size-fits-all response won &apos;t work .
Indeed , we need to abandon the idea that there is a holistic or global Islamist movement .
Political Islam of all colors has emerged as the main alternative to secular Arab nationalist regimes whose legitimacy , based on the struggle for national liberation , has evaporated due to their inability to resolve economic and social problems , establish the rule of law , and guarantee fundamental freedoms .
In Palestine , for example , the Islamists triumphed over Fatah because of years of bad governance under the harsh conditions spawned by Israeli occupation .
Successive European and American governments share an atavistic fear of the &quot; Islamic alternative &quot; to Arab secular nationalists like Fatah , and so have defended the status quo .
But repression of all Arab opposition movements by the region &apos;s monarchs and secular dictators meant that &quot; protection of the Mosque &quot; became the only umbrella under which to engage politically .
Now political Islam can no longer be contained , because democracy cannot be built by driving underground parties that have a strong social base , as was tragically demonstrated in Algeria 15 years ago .
The only alternative to authoritarianism is to craft a transition that allows Islamists to participate in public life and encourages them to accept unequivocally the rules of the democratic game .
There are already many examples of more or less conservative Islamist parties that are willing to play along .
It is no accident that there are Islamists in the legislatures of all the countries undergoing some form of political reform , including Lebanon , where Hezbollah is part of a freely elected government , as well as Jordan and Morocco .
In Egypt , the Muslim Brotherhood has become a strong force in parliament despite the limits imposed on the participation of Islamist groups in last year &apos;s elections .
In Iraq , free elections have revealed the enormous influence of Islamist currents .
In Turkey , the transition to democracy led the Islamist Justice and Development Party to power .
That government has undertaken various important democratic reforms and initiated accession negotiations with the EU .
These Islamist parties have nothing to do with Al Qaeda , even though some of the most conservative among them have adopted somewhat similar ideological positions .
The risk of political transitions that may lead to the victory of Islamist parties is a democratic paradox that Europe and the US must accept if they are to devise inclusive reform policies -- in other words , policies that are the polar opposite of the type of democratic imposition practiced in occupied Iraq .
Indeed , one of the less fortunate consequences of the intervention in Iraq was to reinforce the notion of a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; between the West from Islam , which in turn serves to create a climate favorable to Islamist movements .
After all , political reform movements in the Muslim world emerged long before the US-led &quot; war on terror , &quot; and reformists were not waiting for the EU to become stronger to press for change .
These movements were not created in the US or Europe after September 11 , 2001 , and they will not wait for or depend on the US or the EU to act .
Nevertheless , the success of Muslim moderates may well depend on how the EU and the US respond to pressure for reform and how they decide to encourage change .
It is now necessary to show that democracy is the best path for Palestinians to attain their national goals .
This depends largely on the new Hamas government and its transformation into a democratic force that respects the rule of law , democracy , and international legality .
But it also depends on Israel and the international community , which must do all they can to ensure a future Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital .
Supporting Palestinian democratization does not mean that the international community should not demand that Hamas abandon terror for once and for all , demilitarize , respect the Palestinian constitution , and accept the existence of the state of Israel .
But it also does not mean supporting sanctions that would hurt the Palestinian people after they have expressed their will democratically .
This would be a terrible mistake in any effort to consolidate Palestine &apos;s new democracy , with a negative impact in other reforming countries in the Arab world .
Similarly , accepting the right of non-violent Islamists to participate in public life does not mean giving up on the political and ideological struggle to defeat ultra-conservative , and in some cases totalitarian , conceptions of society .
Combating racism , promoting tolerance , and respecting the religious sentiments of others does not mean that we need to question press freedom or accept Islamists &apos; demands for censorship , even when real religious sentiments are offended , as in the case of the Danish caricatures .
Islamist conceptions of society that violate individual rights must be rebutted politically .
That political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy , which allows all ideas to compete freely with each other .
Political Islam is a risk , but we can minimize it only by devising intelligent , case-sensitive strategies that promote democracy , not by denouncing the results of democratic choice .
The War on &quot; Democratization &quot;
The wars in Lebanon and Gaza constitute a grave threat to democratic reform in the southern Mediterranean .
These wars are inflicting heavy punishment on precisely those peoples who have held fully free and fair elections in the region , while eroding the legitimacy of Israel &apos;s democracy .
At the time of its &quot; Cedar Revolution &quot; last year , Lebanon was held up as the best example so far of democratization in the Arab world .
The enthusiasm with which the international community welcomed those changes now seems all but forgotten , which is also true of recent elections in Palestine -- another longstanding international demand .
The signal being sent is clear : it is preferable that Israel , the only state in the region that abides by the rule of law , be surrounded by authoritarian regimes where political outcomes are predictable than by democratic states where Islamists may well rise to power .
It happened in Palestine , and it could well happen in Egypt if free and fair free elections were held .
As a result , Arab nationalist governments feel justified in resisting serious political reform and vindicated in repressing all domestic opposition , particularly the swelling Islamist movements .
But it should now be clear to everyone that democratization in the southern Mediterranean cannot bypass Islamist movements , and that the success of that process largely depends on the degree to which their full participation in the political arena is ensured .
Of course , this requires their renouncing violence as a means of achieving power .
Repressing political Islam , or attempting to &quot; erase &quot; Islamists militarily with total disregard for national political processes ( not to mention human life ) , is not the answer , because it won &apos;t persuade electorates to turn away from Islamist movements .
The efforts of reformist governments in the region to integrate such movements into the public sphere have been dealt a severe blow .
Democracies have long known that extreme and indiscriminate punishment -- which by definition affects friend and foe , combatant and civilian alike -- is a grave violation of international law , as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , Louise Arbour , has pointed out .
They also know that such action fuels radicalism , leading to the kind of tragic consequences that are all too familiar nowadays .
Hezbollah is , after all , a creature of Lebanon &apos;s resistance to Israel &apos;s 1982 invasion , now trying to reassert its influence at home and in the wider region by portraying itself as a champion of the Arab-Islamic cause , namely in Palestine .
Any reinforcement of its power will necessarily weaken Lebanon and the region &apos;s democratic forces .
The prolonged absence of the United States from truly active engagement in the Middle East peace process is partly to blame for the current situation .
For almost six years , there has been no significant US diplomatic initiative to resolve the Palestinian question or to pursue the Syrian track ( Israel still occupies the Golan Heights ) .
Moreover , just when we were beginning to think that the Iraqi tragedy had made the limits of unilateralism and preemptive military strategies clear to all , the Bush administration encourages Israel &apos;s military action -- this time against a country that has painfully been attempting to consolidate democratic reform and to reafirm its sovereignty in relation to Syria .
Bush &apos;s most promising initiative , promoting democracy across the Middle East , was already dealt a crippling blow by US intervention in Iraq and the ensuing civil war there .
Now the project is buried under the weight of America &apos;s inability to protect Lebanon &apos;s fragile democracy and Palestine &apos;s democratic experiment .
The European Union &apos;s feeble response to the warfare in Gaza and Lebanon has oscillated between understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate use of force by Israel ( described as &quot; ten eyes for one &quot; by the Finnish presidency ) , thereby betraying its dependence on the US to end the violence .
Europeans will have learned nothing from the damaging disunity , and thus weakness , that they displayed during the Iraq war if this conflict does not compel them to speak with one voice .
What is needed is a European initiative that is backed by a credible military deterrent , consisting of forces from the EU , Turkey , and Arab countries , to be dispatched under a UN mandate to Lebanon and Gaza .
Europe must not only put forward a clear demand for an immediate cease-fire and the end to Syrian and Iranian meddling in Lebanon , it must also provide the means to enforce it as well as massive support for Lebanon &apos;s reconstruction .
The EU should decisively back the end of the embargo on Palestine and the urgent creation of a Palestinian state .
A common European front could persuade the US to give Lebanon and Palestine enough time to consolidate their national democratic processes , thus isolating the radical elements of Hamas and steering Hezbollah to dissolution of its private army .
With the US project in ruins , a credible European policy to delegitimize war and support democratization in its neighborhood has become essential .
The Environment of the Economy
No economy is a closed , autonomous universe , governed by rules independent from law , morals , and politics .
Indeed , the most interesting economic questions are generally located on the borderline with neighboring disciplines .
But nowhere is this clearer than in the interaction between economic processes and the natural environment .
The distinctive feature of this exchange is that it is governed not by the laws of mechanics , but by thermodynamics , particularly the law of entropy , according to which the quantity of free energy that can be transformed into mechanical work diminishes with time -- an irreversible process culminating in &quot; heat death . &quot;
Numerous researchers , inspired by the late Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen &apos;s pioneering work on the relationship between economic processes and physics , tried -- not very successfully -- to formulate an &quot; entropic &quot; theory of economy and society , especially during the 1970 &apos;s .
The entropic view assumes that economic processes produce irreversible consequences because of their multiple interactions with nature .
We draw from stocks of non-renewable natural resources ( for example , oil and metal ores ) , and we deteriorate or modify the quality of other resources ( for example , water and arable land ) by imposing on them a rhythm of exploitation superior to their capacity for regeneration .
In fact , the exploitation of non-renewable resources frees the speed of economic growth from that of ecological renewal , aggravating the deterioration of the biosphere , including irreversible climate changes .
The law of entropy reminds us that we will leave to future generations a degraded natural patrimony , probably less adequate to their needs than what we inherited .
Unfortunately , there are no simple answers .
For the sake of what principle can we ask China and India , for example , to limit their economic dynamism so that they use smaller amounts of the planet &apos;s natural resources ?
After all , the advanced countries &apos; slower growth is not the consequence of voluntary self-limitation , but of our superior standard of living -- and of our incapacity to settle our own economic imbalances .
We cannot impose an ecological rhythm on people who are poorer than we are when it is the very fact that we freed ourselves from that rhythm that made us richer .
Economic contraction , or even stagnation , is not a solution for the developed countries , either , for a similar reason : it would imply that we either accept existing inequalities or impose a regime aiming at an equal redistribution of resources .
That choice boils down to an unbearable cynicism or a totalitarian utopia .
But , happily for us , our evolution is determined not only by entropy , but also by the accumulation of knowledge and technological progress -- a process that is just as irreversible as the decrease in stocks of non-renewable resources and the degradation of environmental quality .
Thus , the economy is entropic for resources and historical for the production , organization , and spread of knowledge , with the prospects for economic and environmental sustainability residing in the space left between those two dynamic processes : the level of growth we choose must be conditioned on a sufficient level of knowledge to ensure the system &apos;s survival .
Yet nature , like knowledge , is a public good that needs state intervention to be &quot; produced &quot; in sufficient quantities .
The only way to overcome the finiteness of our world is to maintain as much space as possible between entropy and history by investing in education and research aimed at increasing renewable energies , reducing the energy intensity of our standards of living , and slowing the pace of environmental erosion .
It is widely believed that such a strategy would be useless if the only effect is to allow others to get rich faster by opting out .
But if that strategy is conceived as mastering two dynamic processes , overcoming the ecological constraint could be an accelerator of growth .
The Stem-Cell Race Continues
Scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives , but it is also an industry , one that represents a massive investment by governments and corporations alike .
The stakes and potential rewards for a few research topics are exceptionally high , which is why the recent finding that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk fabricated the results of his work on stem cells has reverberated so widely .
The episode highlights the ongoing race in global health research that is playing out in the field of stem cells .
Possibly one of the biggest prizes in medical history is up for grabs , and anyone -- truly anyone -- could seize it .
The last big scientific race of this type was the effort to map the human genome , which promises to alter future lives radically .
That study was initiated by the United States , which used insights developed in the wake of the atomic bombing of Japan to understand the extent of long-term genetic damage .
The current research effort on stem cells and their potential is just as grand , because it will lead to an equally radical medical revolution .
A stem cell is special because it is able to reproduce a form that is different from itself .
Whereas a skin cell or a liver cell , for instance , can reproduce only more skin or liver , stem cells , which are the most robust at the beginning of human development , are &quot; master &quot; cells .
As a fertilized egg turns into an embryo , and then a fetus , those initial stem cells somehow show their daughter cells how to become skin , liver , eye , or bone .
We need to know how this transformation is activated .
Such knowledge would lead to huge , patentable advances .
Most attention is focused on genetic diseases , such as Alzheimer &apos;s and Parkinson &apos;s , and to muscular dystrophy .
In these cases , stem cells would be encouraged to restore nerve tissue .
This would also benefit patients with brain and spinal injuries , or those who have suffered strokes and paralysis .
There would be gains in parallel fields , too , such as gene therapy .
A stem cell changes its identity through a process of &quot; triggering &quot; -- a signal literally &quot; turns on &quot; the liver cell gene inside the stem version .
When scientists figure out how to flip these switches , it might be possible to introduce stem cells into the body and activate them so that they correctly replace damaged tissue , whatever it is .
Not surprisingly , given its huge potential , teams of scientists have been mobilized almost everywhere for embryonic stem cell research .
The race has become all the more dramatic since the leading researcher , the US , dropped out , owing to the influence of religion on politics ( although the state of California has decided not to miss out , and recently approved a $ 3 billion subsidy for embryonic stem cell research ) .
Because the promise is so great , and the science does not require massive infrastructure , many smaller countries have rushed to take advantage of the absence of the US .
Any competent medical research center can enter the race , whether in Mexico , Ethiopia , Indonesia or Yemen .
Whoever wins will have added the equivalent of a Saudi oil field to their economy .
But , although anyone can win , science at this level is never a &quot; eureka &quot; event , with some single breakthrough suddenly ending the race .
Discoveries occur incrementally , and , because it is science , each step is announced and tested .
Research establishments gain momentum this way , with the leaders sweeping up talent , resources , and prestige in a rough-and-tumble intellectual ecology .
Embedded in the larger race are many smaller ones , which jostle for early , impressive results .
In May 2005 , Hwang &apos;s research center in Seoul reported the first major achievement .
They claimed that they had developed a technique whereby new , perfect stem cells could be cloned from ordinary ones .
This was big news , for it implied that sufficient numbers of stem cells could be made without controversy , thus allowing anyone to be able to do quality research while avoiding what US President George W. Bush described as &quot; taking a life to save a life . &quot;
More importantly , the Koreans did a common thing these days : they claimed patent rights over the process .
It almost looked for a moment as though South Korea would become a world superpower in health matters .
We now know that the Seoul researchers made up the whole thing .
An investigation by a Seoul National University investigative panel has concluded that the &quot; cloned &quot; stem cells were really created by test-tube fertilizations .
The fraud has bewildered the science community , particularly because the claim that the Korean researchers made was so transparently false .
Why , then , did they place their reputations and careers in jeopardy ?
Medical research has always faced many challenges , even when the scientific quest was simply one of discovery .
Now , the challenges are complicated by politics , market forces , and national interests .
With stem cell research , huge fortunes depend on which group takes the lead , wherever their laboratory is located .
As the competition heats up , we should expect amazing developments -- and no doubt more public relations gimmicks .
Islam versus Asia &apos;s Chinese Diaspora
When Malaysia &apos;s prime minister , Dr Mahathir Mohamed , recently announced that he intended to resign , Malaysians of Chinese descent joined Mahathir &apos;s Malay party loyalists in demanding that he reconsider .
When Mahathir agreed to stay on , if only for another 16 months , the sighs of relief from these Chinese Malaysians were the loudest of all .
That ethnic Chinese Malaysians rallied to Dr. Mahathir &apos;s side marks a quiet revolution in Malaysian politics , one that demonstrates how much Mahathir &apos;s nationalist image has softened during his 22 years in power .
It also shows how much Malaysia &apos;s ethnic Chinese have changed in their views about the nationalist movement that once seemed so antagonistic to them .
When Southeast Asia &apos;s colonial rulers were overthrown four decades ago , ethnic Chinese often shunned the nationalist movements that fought for independence .
Some movements saw the local Chinese as outsiders or as intrinsically disloyal for seeming to have benefited disproportionately during the years of imperial rule .
Across the region , anti-Chinese communal violence was widespread .
In the decades since , many Chinese remained suspicious of political parties with ties to the former national liberation movements .
In Malaysia , that fear is dissipating .
Malaysia &apos;s Chinese citizens now view Premier Mahathir as a bastion against a new form of violent extremism : the threat posed by Muslim fundamentalism .
Such a bulwark is something members of the vast Chinese diaspora across Southeast Asia need , not only in Malaysia , where Islamic extremism remains a small threat , but in Indonesia , where thousands of Chinese have been killed and injured in rioting in recent years , and where thousands more have seen their property damaged or lost .
Among most of Southeast Asia &apos;s ethnic Chinese , the presence of even a hint of allegiance to a secular distinction between faith and state in a Muslim leader is admired like a precious gem .
When found among Islamic believers like Mahathir , evidence of secular tolerance represents a rare sign of modernity and commitment to progress .
Dr. Mahathir has always been a hard-headed modernist .
Lately , he has begun to admit that the &quot; Malay first &quot; policies he has promoted since 1969 have failed to produce the skilled Malay elite essential to a modern knowledge economy .
Mahathir calls for young Malays to work harder , despite knowing that this is an unpopular thing to say .
Much of this new tone in Malaysia &apos;s ethnic politics has gone unnoticed due to the furor surrounding Mahathir &apos;s efforts to discredit his former deputy , Anwar Ibrahim .
This campaign to denigrate Mr. Anwar cost Mahathir &apos;s party , the United Malay National Organization ( UMNO ) , much support among ethnic Malays .
Indeed , during the 1999 national elections , Mahathir retained power only with the help of Chinese voters .
Now non-Malays hope that he will reconsider the idea of special treatment for ethnic Malays .
Such reform , however , remains anathema among Malays .
Malaysia &apos;s ethnic Chinese are also impressed by Dr. Mahathir &apos;s skillful response to American demands to combat terrorism .
The Premier used this opportunity to soften his anti-Western image by re-affirming his modernist and secular position against those who sympathized with Islamic extremism .
By doing so he revitalized the multi-cultural base of the National Alliance that has ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957 .
All of this helped rally Malaysia &apos;s Chinese community to his side .
Contrast this with the Chinese in Indonesia , a country where everything secular and modern is associated with political and cultural conformity to the nation-state .
For thirty years , former President Suharto systematically discriminated against ethnic Chinese , while at the same time favoring a few select Chinese cronies , who helped his family and military colleagues make huge , ill-gotten profits .
For the indigenous majority who remained poor , such cronyism spawned an image of the Chinese as corrupt and unscrupulously greedy .
Despite memories of the slaughter of Chinese during the anti-communist purges of the 1960s , Indonesia &apos;s Chinese were unprepared for the intense hatred shown in the riots of May 1998 , when arson and looting , as well as gang rapes of numerous Chinese women , battered the Chinese community .
Such violence still casts a shadow over ethnic relations in Indonesia .
Successive Indonesian governments headed by Presidents Habibie , Abdulrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri all welcomed the Chinese to play their customary leading role in business .
Yet Indonesian officials waver from assuring the Chinese that they retain equal rights as citizens , and they have allowed various forms of discrimination to run rampant .
Today &apos;s tensions between Indonesia &apos;s secularists , religious believers , and various Muslim extremist groups has taken the spotlight off the Chinese , allowing many to resume their economic role under conditions of growing uncertainty .
But the personal security they crave , and which Malaysia &apos;s ethnic Chinese are achieving , is as far away as ever .
Indeed , Indonesia is unlikely any time soon to produce a leader they can depend upon in ways that Malaysia &apos;s Chinese now rely upon Premier Mahathir .
Football and Philosophy
Gooooal ! ! !
Heavenly bliss , or hellish pain , depending on which team has scored : ours , or theirs .
How can the trajectory of a ball cause so much pain or bliss ?
For weeks I have sat at my television watching the World Cup .
My wife threatens me with divorce and other disciplinary measures .
What is the source of this attraction , this magic ?
The world of play is our permanent Garden of Eden .
At any moment we may step from our real world into the freedom , innocence , and bliss of play .
Football and the Garden of Eden ?
What do they have to do with each other ?
Each delineates a sacred sphere of freedom and order , innocence , spirituality and justice from our everyday world of chaos , bondage , injustice and guilt .
The chessboard , the tennis court , the soccer field : within their boundaries we feel free because here it is we who make the rules and are not subjected to the iron laws of the outside world .
We feel innocent too , because the world of play is also a world of innocence : a Garden of Eden before the Fall .
Here we can be childishly selfish , we can gratify our thirst for success , power and domination - all without guilt .
In the world of play freedom is generated , paradoxically , by restrictions .
In soccer , the basic rule is simple : the ball is to be moved , from the central point , into one of the goals .
If the ball would roll from the center point straight into one of the goals , its track would be , or would seem to be , strictly determined and the whole thing would be boring .
To generate freedom , rules put obstacles in the way of the ball and complicate its movement .
First , two teams of eleven players are put on the field with the task of getting the ball into the goal .
Second , they are told to get the ball into opposite goals .
With twenty-two players with their own wills and skills , with various movements of confrontation and cooperation , the number of possible combinations is increased almost ad infinitum .
After this only one additional factor is needed to create a real world of happy surprises , freedom and bliss : the ball .
Balls are among the most important &quot; freedom generators &quot; in our lives .
A ball is freedom embodied .
It may bounce in any direction .
It seems to have its &quot; own will . &quot;
It is an object and , nevertheless , it seems to be free .
By introducing the factor of chance and unpredictability into the game , the ball transforms a bitter and down-to-earth human fight into an epiphany of spirituality and freedom .
In its brisk movements chance and human will interact , dance , and somersault with each other .
The ball flashes to and fro in happy irresponsibility - between human will and chance , freedom and limitation , success and failure , hope and the loss of hope - to bounce back into the world of hope in the next moment .
It has its own universe .
It moves in the sphere of the sacred .
But that sacred does not exist without the profane .
The football field is marked off and opposed to the surrounding world .
The experience and the sacred ceremony remain incomplete if tension between the field and the grandstand is missing .
The clean emerald field and freedom of the game must be opposed by the howling mob in the darkness of the stands , burning red torches and jerking between ecstatic joy and hellish misery .
In our everyday lives , reason and passions are mixed .
Soccer ( like some other games ) separates , and opposes to each other , these two realms .
All passions , emotions and instincts are pushed over to the side of the spectators .
They rage and love , prance and explode , and finally reach a catharsis ( if their team wins ) or to descend into hell ( if their team loses ) .
At the same time , they watch , perceive , and experience the freedom of Apollonian or Platonic spirituality of the game going on in the field .
Yes , players move in a world of spirituality .
They act according to clear , sacred rules .
While in play , they are supposed to act as pure rational beings who leave behind their everyday passions and emotions , personal wishes or fears .
They move in the world of pure morality and justice .
The player &apos;s world is one of justice and total impartiality ; of a perfect equality of opportunity , which is never achieved in our everyday lives .
Even advantages deriving from the direction of the wind are balanced .
The two teams change sides at the half .
When and where do we , the privileged and the underprivileged , change sides in the real world ?
Players , too , are not supposed to break the rules .
If they do , they are punished and , if they relapse , excluded from play .
They are expelled from the sphere of spirituality and we see them disappearing into the chilly Hades of the locker room .
The real expulsion from Paradise comes only if the sanctity of play is profaned , if the spell is broken : by players falling out of their angelic roles and starting a fight in the field ; by a cheating referee ; by people realizing that a match is rigged ; by spectators invading the field .
Such events do lasting damage to people and to the community .
It is a bitter shock to realize the fragility of our world of freedom , spirituality , and dignity and awaken again ( as we will when the Cup winner is decided ) in our less hospitable everyday world .
Egypt Needs a President , Not a Pharaoh
Egypt is undergoing a heated nationwide debate over political reform .
The central issue is a demand by all opposition parties and civil society groups to amend the 1971 constitution and abolish the 23-year-old State of Emergency that was imposed following Anwar Sadat &apos;s assassination in 1981 .
Such demands are not new .
But President Hosni Mubarak and the ruling National Democratic Party have been stonewalling since the mid-1980 &apos;s .
What makes the demands for reform more pressing this time are ominous developments in Egypt , the region , and in the wider world .
At home , concern about Mubarak &apos;s age ( 76 ) and deteriorating health has grown .
Mubarak &apos;s ill health , widely rumored for years , was never officially acknowledged until November 2003 , when it could no longer be covered up .
While speaking to Parliament , Mubarak fainted before millions of TV viewers .
Although he returned an hour later and delivered the rest of his speech , Egyptians began to demand greater transparency regarding the president &apos;s health as well as other state affairs .
Meanwhile , Egypt &apos;s sagging economy , high unemployment rate , and rampant corruption have driven many Egyptian youngsters to despair .
More than one half of living Egyptians were born since Mubarak assumed office .
According to a recent report by the UN Development Program , roughly half of those between 15 and 30 years old dream of emigrating to Europe , North America , or Australia .
There are weekly reports of would-be illegal Egyptian immigrants drowning in the Mediterranean .
A few weeks ago , several youngsters suffocated to death while being deported back to Egypt across the Libyan desert in overloaded trucks .
The incident caused an uproar that compelled the authorities to arrest , interrogate , and try the Egyptian police officers in charge .
Regional and international events have also emboldened the Egyptian opposition , not only to press for reform , but to focus on amending the constitution &apos;s articles that pertain to the presidency .
Mubarak has been re-elected four times , and rumors have persisted that he will either seek a fifth six-year term or establish a &quot; hereditary republic &quot; and groom his 41-year old son , Gamal , to succeed him , like Syria &apos;s Hafez al-Assad and son , Bashar .
The opposition battle cry is &quot; No &quot; to Mubarak &apos;s re-election and &quot; No &quot; to passing the presidency to Gamal .
Many Egyptians may not have major misgivings about Gamal Mubarak per se , but they find it mortifying that , after 24 years of the father , they might be stuck with another 24 or more years of the son .
The current constitution was adopted in October 1971 , and has 211 articles , 30 of which concern the presidency .
The president is nominated by two-thirds of the People &apos;s Assembly , and endorsed in a plebiscite that allows only for a simple &quot; Yes &quot; or &quot; No . &quot;
A simple majority of the ballots is required to win a six-year term , which is renewable indefinitely by the same process .
These lax procedures contrast jarringly with the president &apos;s powers .
The president is the head of state and commander-in-chief ; officiates over the Supreme Judiciary Council , the Supreme Police Council , and the Cabinet of Ministers ; and can appoint and recall one or more vice-presidents at his sole discretion .
He also appoints the prime minister and senior ministers , and must approve all other ministers , ambassadors , and state representatives .
He can call general elections , declare war , impose a state of emergency , and issue decrees that have the force of law .
There are no checks and balances on these powers .
A single article stipulates that , &quot; Accusation of the President of committing grand treason or any other criminal act may be made upon a motion submitted by at least one-third of members of the People &apos;s Assembly and approved by two-thirds . &quot;
The president is then suspended from carrying out his duties , and the vice-president fills in until the accusation is resolved .
But Mubarak has never enacted the law essential to implementing this article or appointed a vice-president , despite repeated popular demands to do so .
The result has been a de facto &quot; imperial presidency , &quot; with Mubarak likened to the god-king Pharaohs of ancient Egypt .
No other head of state in modern times enjoys as much power .
A more apt analogy popular in Egypt compares Mubarak to Leonid Brezhnev , who for two decades presided over the Soviet Union &apos;s stagnation and decline .
Egypt &apos;s status as a regional power under Mubarak has similarly weakened steadily .
On the economic front , annual foreign investment inflows have plummeted from $ 3 billion in the mid-1990 &apos;s to a minuscule $ 300 million in 2003 .
Demands for reform are now focused on introducing direct presidential elections with two or more contenders , and limiting presidents to two consecutive terms in office .
It is no less important to reduce the presidency &apos;s sweeping powers and formulate viable mechanisms for enforcing the accountability of all public officials without exception .
Should Mubarak and his government fail to recommend constitutional amendments that satisfy these demands , ever more Egyptians will desert the regime and risk their lives in search of salvation in other lands .
Bush &apos;s Second Gulf Disaster
President Bush has asked that Americans not &quot; play politics &quot; at this moment of terrible national disaster .
But asking hard questions of our nation &apos;s leaders is exactly what democracy demands when the government &apos;s response to Hurricane Katrina is widely viewed as &quot; a national disgrace . &quot;
Katrina came with at least two days &apos; warning , but authorities waited to issue an evacuation order .
There was no transportation for people without cars or money , facilities to house and care for refugees were insufficient , there were no forces in place to deliver desperately needed supplies or to secure order , and there was nowhere near the number of boats , helicopters , and other craft necessary to rescue the stranded .
Hampered by a National Guard with 40 % of its people in Iraq , the pace of getting military personnel to the hardest hit areas was inordinately slow .
For four days , there was simply no clear center of command and control .
As a result , countless people suffered and died .
Much of this failure is the result of the Bush administration &apos;s policies , which effectively eroded the capacities of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , the government agency primarily responsible for dealing with disasters .
Obsessed with the war on terror as well as an ideology of privatizing the functions of government , the administration systematically sapped FEMA &apos;s long-term ability to prevent disaster or at least cushion the blows when prevention is not possible .
FEMA was downsized and downgraded from a cabinet position , then placed under the Department of Homeland Security .
Its mission of disaster planning and preparation was dropped entirely , and its focus was altered to fight terrorists .
Its leadership had no experience in disaster management .
The past director was one of Bush &apos;s Texas political cronies , and the current director &apos;s qualifications include a stint as commissioner for judges and stewards with the International Arabian Horse Association , where he was asked to resign for &quot; supervision failures . &quot;
Since 2001 , billions of dollars were shifted from disaster relief to homeland security and the war in Iraq .
Key disaster mitigation programs were slashed and federal funding for post-disaster relief was cut in half .
The Army Corps of Engineers &apos; budget for levee construction in New Orleans was gutted , including funds specifically aimed at the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project .
Preventive measures to protect people and property were not carried out despite FEMA &apos;s own conclusion in 2001 that a major hurricane hitting New Orleans was one of the three &quot; likeliest , most catastrophic disasters facing this country . &quot;
Believing FEMA to be an &quot; oversized entitlement program &quot; and that the &quot; business of government is not to provide services , &quot; Bush &apos;s first FEMA director instituted new outsourcing requirements as part of a major privatization effort .
This provoked a brain drain as experienced FEMA personnel moved into the private sector
Privatization also left poorer states and poorer communities especially vulnerable .
As money dried up and federal programs were contracted out to private firms at higher rates , only the richest and politically most important states and communities could compete successfully for the scarce federal grants necessary to pay for services .
For example , Florida ( with 16 more electoral votes than Louisiana and where the president &apos;s brother governs ) received its requested funding to protect its wetlands .
By contrast , a more needy Louisiana ( with its staggering 24 % poverty rate ) was denied its request for flood-mitigation funds in 2004 .
With Louisiana &apos;s ability to protect itself weakened and the center of disaster relief badly undermined , an inadequate government response and unnecessary destruction were almost inevitable -- with the poor paying the price .
But the failure of this administration runs deeper than its chronic and intentional diversion of resources away from the types of policies that keep people safe from disaster .
Despite scientific evidence demonstrating that the increased intensity and frequency of hurricanes is related to climate change , the Bush administration systematically rejects participation in international climate-protection regimes .
Rather than continue a ban on wetlands development instituted by previous administrations , the Bush administration overturned it .
Because development-provoked erosion has brought the Gulf of Mexico 20 miles closer to land than it was in 1965 , hurricanes are able to retain more strength , and their winds and waves pack more speed and destructive power .
Similarly , loss of wetlands threatened New Orleans &apos; levees , which were built on the assumption that they would have 40 to 50 miles of protective swamp as buffer between the city and the Gulf of Mexico .
Despite every major study showing that a massive coastal restoration program and higher levees were needed to protect New Orleans , the administration permitted federal agencies to stop protecting 20 million acres of wetlands , allowed developers to drain thousands of acres and in 2004 cut funding for holding back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain by more than 80 % .
New Orleans is America &apos;s canary in the mineshaft .
Ideologies of privatization that incapacitate effective government , permitting the privileged to save themselves while leaving the poor clinging to roofs , must now be challenged .
This disaster is a chilling reminder of what happens when government fails to protect its citizens , and it is imperative that Americans demand accountability .
Officials who did not do their jobs must be dismissed , and elected officials whose policies aggravated the devastation wrought by Katrina must be removed from office .
We owe this to the dead and to the survivors .
The Autumn of the Commandante
The death watch for Fidel Castro is something that only Gabriel Garcia Marquez could get right .
His novel Autumn of the Patriarch captures perfectly the moral squalor , political paralysis , and savage ennui that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator .
Commandante Fidel &apos;s departure from power , of course , will be solely a matter of biology , and the few pictures of him that have emerged since he took ill last year clearly show biology at work .
When the end comes , change in Cuba could be as vast as any that greeted the end of the last century &apos;s great dictators .
Stalin , Franco , Tito , Mao : all were mostly alike in their means and methods .
How they passed from the scene , however , was often very different , and these differences can shape societies for years and decades to come .
Consider the Soviet Union .
On March 9 , 1953 , from the Gulf of Finland to the Bering Sea , everything stood still ; likewise in Warsaw , Budapest , Prague , and East Berlin .
In Beijing , Mao Zedong himself bowed low before an immense effigy of Joseph Stalin .
Huge mourning crowds , crying , nearly hysterical , could be seen all over the vast empire Stalin had ruled .
Yet , within days , the word Stalinism was being expunged from a new Soviet dictionary , and three years later my grandfather , Nikita Khrushchev , denounced Stalin &apos;s &quot; cult of personality &quot; in his famous &quot; Secret Speech &quot; to the Communist Party &apos;s XXth Congress .
The Khrushchev thaw that followed may have been short-lived , but for the first time in Soviet history the possibility of change was opened -- a possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seized upon in 1985 .
The death of Marshal Josip Broz Tito brought forth an outpouring of another sort .
For decades , his personal rule imposed a false unity on Yugoslavia .
Following his death in 1980 , that artificial state began to unravel , culminating in the genocidal wars in Bosnia , Croatia , and Kosovo of the 1990 &apos;s .
Not all long-term dictatorships , however , end in disintegration and mayhem .
Mao &apos;s death allowed for Deng Xiaoping &apos;s return from disgrace and internal exile .
Deng quickly routed Mao &apos;s &quot; Gang of Four &quot; heirs , and in only a few years opened China &apos;s economy , fueling a capitalist revolution that has transformed China far more completely -- and successfully -- than Mao &apos;s socialist revolution ever did .
The Communist Party , of course , remains in power , and Mao &apos;s portrait still looms over Tiananmen Square .
But both are mere relics of ideas and ideals that in reality have been consigned to the dustbin of history .
Spain , too , escaped violent dissolution when Generalissimo Francisco Franco &apos;s fascist dictatorship collapsed at his death .
Here the old dictator can take some credit , for by re-establishing the monarchy under King Juan Carlos just before he died , Franco provided Spain with a foundation on which to build anew .
Little did Franco realize that what Juan Carlos would build , with the help of a clever young Franco-era bureaucrat named Adolfo Suarez , was the modern , democratic Spain of today .
It was no accident that communist countries were ( and are ) usually run by geriatric leaders , and democracies by younger men and women .
That difference matters .
Old leaders can preside successfully over smoothly running countries that need no radical re-examination of their policies and purposes .
There are exceptions to this rule , of course -- Churchill , Adenauer , Deng , Reagan -- but states cannot count on fortune bringing an exceptional ruler their way .
Younger leaders are more likely to be able to cope with the chop and change of difficult times .
Political competition makes it necessary for all politicians , whatever their age , to stay on their toes , anticipate new problems , and remain open to new ideas aimed at addressing them .
No one can keep himself ensconced in high office subject only to death or his own boredom .
One-party systems , one-man charismatic dictatorships , or a mixture of the two , as in Tito &apos;s Yugoslavia , are a guarantee of sclerotic minds and inert governments .
So what will become of Cuba after Fidel departs ?
Many observers portray Raúl Castro , Fidel &apos;s younger brother and designated heir , as a pragmatist -- the &quot; practical Castro . &quot;
When Cuba &apos;s lavish Soviet subsidies vanished in the early 1990 &apos;s , it was Raúl who recognized that the regime &apos;s survival required economic reforms , pressing to allow private agricultural markets to reopen in order to boost food production and stave off possible starvation .
However , this is the same man who , as the head of Cuba &apos;s internal security apparatus , for many years represented the knuckles of an iron-fisted regime , directly responsible for imprisoning -- and often torturing -- thousands of dissidents .
So perhaps the best that could be hoped for is a Russian-style experiment with liberalization that is quickly called off by the regime &apos;s nervous Old Guard .
Moreover , with the support of oil-rich allies like Venezuela &apos;s President Hugo Chávez -- and with the recent discovery of significant crude reserves off Cuba &apos;s own coast -- introducing reforms could well become less urgent .
In that case , Raúl may seek to cling grimly to the fossilized system that he helped build and maintain with such brutality .
But Raúl Castro is an old man himself , so we can hope for the prospect that some Deng or , better yet , a Suarez will ultimately emerge from the wreckage of Fidelism .
But for now , younger communist officials , like Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque , remain ideological hardliners whom many Cubans refer to as &quot; los Taliban . &quot;
If they take control and stick to their guns , Cuba could face another long biology lesson .
Ecb Is Now Europe &apos;s Anchor
The European Central Bank is making its reputation at this time of turmoil and crisis .
Barely a month after the rejection of the European Union Constitution in France and the Netherlands , the EU Summit in Brussels ended in a surprisingly acrimonious orgy of national egoisms and no deal . Then the terrorists struck in London .
With all this trouble , the ECB is showing itself to be an &quot; anchor of stability &quot; by steadfastly sticking to its mandate of insuring price stability .
Europe suffers from a profound crisis of confidence .
Its economy , for example , cannot recover properly because consumers , lacking confidence in the ability of their political leaders to solve the economy &apos;s manifold economic problems ( budget deficits , pensions , etc . ) , are saving for a rainy day they feel is just around the corner — and businessmen are reluctant to invest , because they don &apos;t trust government to make the necessary economic reforms .
The public &apos;s lack of confidence in the EU &apos;s political leadership is totally justified .
Instead of actually doing something constructive about Europe &apos;s essential problem --reforming expensive welfare states to ensure global competitiveness--Europe &apos;s political leaders are hiding behind straw man arguments about &quot; ultra liberal Anglo Saxon models , &quot; and pressuring the ECB to lower interest rates as if European economic weakness were Frankfurt &apos;s fault .
Europe &apos;s finance ministers portray the ECB as closed to dialogue .
When testifying before the EU Parliament &apos;s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , Luxembourg prime minister and Euro-group chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said there should be &quot; open and frank &quot; talks between the euro-group ministers and the ECB — and French finance minister Dominique de Villepin said the same thing .
According to a knowledgeable ECB source , however , Europe &apos;s finance ministers regularly meet in secret with the ECB leadership for a mutual and frank exchange of views on monetary policy and other issues .
The dialogue already exists though the public does not know it . Such disingenuousness does little to boost confidence in Europe &apos;s political leadership .
The ECB has done all it can for growth by giving Europe a prolonged period of monetary stability at record low interest rates .
Does anyone really believe consumers are holding back on spending — and businessmen postponing their investments — in anticipation of that next drop in interest rates ?
To paraphrase Keynes , you can lead a horse to water but you can &apos;t make him drink .
&quot; The last thing Europe needs now is an interest rate cut , &quot; says one influential member of the ECB Governing Council in a candid assessment of the current situation . Capitulating to outside political pressure is no one &apos;s definition of an &quot; anchor of stability . &quot;
The euro would collapse , and the ECB finished as a creditable central bank .
Moreover , ECB chief economist Otmar Issing predicts long- term interest rates would go up — not down — as inflationary expectations increased .
So cutting interest rates would not only be stupid — it would be crazy .
But the ECB is not going to cut rates even though , for public relations reasons of keeping the political wolves at bay , it deceptively hints it might .
Don &apos;t be fooled by such feints . The ECB is holding fast and , in doing so , demonstrates to Europe &apos;s peoples that there is at least one EU institution they can trust .
This is vital .
History shows political turmoil often leads to inflation , which only fuels further turmoil .
Europeans can bet their last euro the ECB will not let the fledgling common currency be ravaged by inflation because their political leaders , having failed to do their jobs , now fear they might lose them .
Indeed , the courage currently demonstrated by the ECB in sticking to its guns should serve as a model for Europe &apos;s future politicians .
Once they realize they can &apos;t bully the ECB into unwanted and self-destructive interest rate cuts , EU leaders actually might summon up the will to lead — which is , after all , what they have been elected to do .
The Arafat Succession Scramble
To understand what the Palestinian cause will look like without Yasir Arafat , consider the various titles that he currently holds .
Arafat is Chairman of the PLO executive Committee , President of the Palestinian National Authority , Commander-in-chief of the Palestinian forces , and head of the Fatah movement .
The PLO embodies Palestinian national aspirations for independence and statehood .
It is the highest political body for all Palestinians , both those living in Palestine and the refugees and other Palestinians in the diaspora .
Arafat &apos;s successor will need to juggle between negotiations with Israel , which will require concession on refugees &apos; &quot; right of return &quot; to Palestine , and the aspirations of more than three million Palestinians who wish to come back to the homes from which they were expelled in the wars of 1948 and 1967 .
Arafat &apos;s successor as President of the Palestinian National Authority will be bound by the Oslo Accords , which created an interim government , now headed by Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei , that is responsible for the day-to-day lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza .
Palestinians will have to decide whether to make the position of PNA president a powerful one or merely symbolic , as it now is .
The latter option would make Qurei an empowered prime minister , which is what many Palestinians and others want .
The position of the commander of the Palestinian forces supposedly puts the various Palestinian military , security , and intelligence units under one leader , who is expected to ensure the rule of law .
But these forces are now in disarray , with most uniformed Palestinian security agencies needing to be reorganized after four years of intensive effort by Israel to crush them .
The key factor in internal security is local paramilitary units .
These units , most of which are not controlled by the PNA &apos;s central leadership , are more loyal to grassroots figures than to uniformed PNA officers .
Local Fatah leaders like Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of the Al Aqsa Martyrs &apos; Brigades .
Barghouti advocated and was trying to implement internal Fatah elections when the Israelis arrested him .
As a street leader who was elected as the head of the Bir Zeit University student council , he gained legitimacy by being chosen by his peers .
When the Oslo process began , he refused to accept any official position within the Palestinian Authority , choosing instead to remain close to the local Fatah cadres .
Whoever fills Arafat &apos;s shoes will need to make sure that these brigades are satisfied that their status , demands , and leaders are respected .
Indeed , the power struggle that will ensue in the post-Arafat era will ultimately center on Al Fatah , the backbone of the PLO .
A worldwide assembly chooses Fatah &apos;s 100-member revolutionary council , which in turn elects a 20-member central committee , where most of the power struggle will take place .
Many young street leaders will insist on an emergency meeting of the revolutionary council , or even holding the sixth general assembly ( which would be the first since 1988 ) .
Events in recent months show that the Al Asqa Martyrs &apos; Brigades have forced even Arafat to take their demands into consideration .
While much of the power struggle will take place within the nationalist camp , one must not overlook the Islamist camp led by Hamas and Islamic Jihad .
Although the Islamists are unlikely to interfere in the post-Arafat power struggle , they will not sit idly by if the new leadership moves in what they consider the wrong direction .
Of course , the new leadership will have to reach some agreement with the Islamists regarding the rules of the game , both domestically and vis-à-vis Israel .
Without such an agreement , and if the new leadership cracks down hard on the Islamists , a violent civil war could erupt .
Most importantly , in order to consolidate his leadership , the next Palestinian leader must make some hard decisions and show some tangible results quickly .
The experience of the first Palestinian prime minister , who resigned largely because of his inability to deliver any improvements to his people -- particularly personal and collective security , the rule of law , and an end to chaos in Palestinian areas -- remains fresh in the public &apos;s memory .
At the same time , a freeze on settlement activities , release of Palestinian political prisoners -- including Marwan Barghouti -- and the removal of the hundreds of checkpoints between Palestinian cities would revive a feeling of hope , without which no Palestinian leader can negotiate what the world wants : a peace settlement .
The problem is that no Palestinian leader , no matter who he is , can deliver these changes .
They represent a direct challenge to the Israeli occupiers , neighboring Arab countries , and the international community , led by the United States .
The Moscow Mystery of 2008
Usually at this time of year , people are obsessed with what the coming year will bring .
But in Russia , the real uncertainty concerns 2008 , not 2007 .
Indeed , one can boil Russian politics down to one issue nowadays : Will President Vladimir Putin stay on as president after 2008 , despite repeatedly stating that he won &apos;t ?
And if he indeed steps down , whom will he groom as his replacement ?
Will his chosen successor belong to one of the Kremlin &apos;s feuding factions ?
Or will he pick an &quot; outsider &quot; ?
Unless Putin maintains his stature as the country &apos;s ultimate arbiter and decision-taker , there is a high risk of fierce infighting .
In an environment where power and property are inseparable and all government institutions are emasculated , a major transfer of authority at the top may lead to violent redistribution .
Thus , resolving these questions is vital for Russia &apos;s political elites who are anxious to preserve the current perks and gain more .
As for the public , the vast majority appears resigned to accepting whatever is arranged by the leadership .
Fully 45 % of Russians believe that Putin will name a successor , and that this person will become the new president .
Almost a quarter believe that the constitution will be changed so that Putin can have a third term .
Either way , it is almost universally understood that the transfer of presidential authority is masterminded at the top and endorsed at the ballot box .
The balance of forces in the legislature , too , will be determined by the Kremlin .
Over the past years the configuration of the political parties and the election legislation have been repeatedly modified so as to suit the interests of the ruling elite .
As a result unwanted forces have no chance in next December &apos;s parliamentary election .
Alienated from politics , ordinary Russians are indifferent to everything that does not immediately affect them , and do not seek to hold anyone accountable .
They were not bothered by the journalist Anna Politkovskaya &apos;s recent murder or the assassination of Andrey Kozlov , first deputy chairman of the central bank , or the implications of Alexander Litvinenko &apos;s poisoning ( a majority in a recent poll said he was killed by his &quot; business partners &quot; ) .
The alienation between the state and the people has a long tradition in Russia , and so does public apathy .
But these days the apathy is reinforced by improved living standards .
Thanks to windfall revenues from oil and gas , Russians live better than ever in the postcommunist times .
Moreover , it may be argued that never in Russian history has the proportion of those who enjoy reasonably decent lifestyles been as high as it is today .
As a result , people have become even more compliant in the face of increasingly autocratic governance .
Of course , there are plenty of reasons to complain , and people may grumble , but they won &apos;t come together to oppose the status quo .
Marginal political groups and figures who stage protests increasingly find themselves confronting official pressure and even harassment -- all the more reason for the broad public to turn away from them .
Since the election results are preordained , many may simply not vote .
In fact , today &apos;s Russian state barely has a reason to muster active support .
On the contrary , public participation is seen as an obstacle to the goals pursued by the bureaucracy : self-perpetuation and expanding control over lucrative assets .
If any among the Russian elite ever nursed modernizing ambitions , they have abandoned them , for without public participation , modernization is a fallacy .
Instead , the Kremlin increasingly draws on the conservative , Soviet-style electorate as its power base , while alienating the advanced , the entrepreneurial , and the best educated .
Stephen Jennings , the chairman of the board of Renaissance Capital , an investment group with a decade of experience in Russia , recently noted the country &apos;s &quot; contradictory trends &quot; : the emergence of a &quot; burgeoning middle class &quot; alongside a &quot; highly centralized government , breeding a new class of state oligarchs and a mushrooming bureaucracy . &quot;
The problem is that Russia &apos;s best and brightest , which Jennings praised for &quot; high management skills , professionalism , productivity , and social and economic ambition , &quot; don &apos;t seem to mind their alienation from policy-making .
They may resent the Kremlin &apos;s economic policies , but they put up with Russia &apos;s rampant corruption and its disgraceful ratings in competitiveness indices , just as they put up with the general erosion of democracy , manipulation of the judiciary , and weak law enforcement .
Like their less advanced compatriots , they don &apos;t seek to hold the government accountable or call for change .
For the time being , life is good enough as it is .
Thus , if there is any threat to a smooth transition in 2008 , or a risk of subsequent destabilization , it may stem from infighting at the top , not from the public .
Optimists hope that at some point Russia &apos;s burgeoning middle class will assume responsibility for Russia &apos;s future and demand a radical improvement in governance .
But what would trigger a shift from passive compliance to active public participation ?
If good times breed political apathy , and bad policies lead to a socioeconomic decline , Russia &apos;s best and brightest may find themselves outstripped by populist forces .
The Anti-Drug God that Failed
Russians and Ukrainians are once again being made victims of a utopian dream .
Since the end of communism in 1991 , these countries ( and others ) have experienced a dramatic increase in the use of illicit drugs .
They have responded with draconian policies that mirror the simplistic message of a drug-free society espoused by UN drug treaties and the institutions that seek to enforce them .
Today , these policies are contributing to an explosion of HIV infections in much of the developing world .
The UN treaties that guide global drug policy reflect none of the recent findings on drug use and addiction .
Indeed , most UN drug conventions were enacted long before the appearance of HIV / AIDS--a disease fuelled by injection drug use in the former Soviet Union and many parts of Asia .
Consider Russia and Ukraine , which have the world &apos;s fastest-growing rate of HIV infection .
The number of people infected with HIV in Russia and Ukraine has increased by more than 18 times over the past five years .
As many as 1.5 million Russians and 400,000 Ukrainians are estimated to have HIV ; at least 85 % of known infections are attributed to intravenous drug use .
Governments in Russia and Ukraine allocate the bulk of their drug-related resources to law enforcement in a misguided attempt to comply with the UN drug treaties .
Individual users suffer police abuse and are driven away from vital health and treatment services .
Meanwhile , the flow of drugs continues undiminished .
Repressive policies have never succeeded in eliminating demand for drugs .
They do not tackle any of the economic , social , or health factors associated with the use of illicit drugs .
Locking up drug users is not a solution--in Russia , it is easier to score drugs in prison than outside .
Moreover , in a repressive climate , drug users who avoid arrest are more likely to face increased discrimination , reducing their motivation to take measures to protect their own health and the health of those around them .
In such circumstances--without hope for a better future or the opportunity for compassion-based interaction with society--drug use and HIV spread rapidly .
Russia and Ukraine are not alone in facing these twin epidemics .
Pakistan , Iran , China , the Central Asian countries , and other places with rising rates of intravenous drug use are bound for the same public health catastrophe if they pursue similar discredited policies .
Public health intervention to reduce the damage caused by drugs has been proven--by decades of research in dozens of countries--to be vastly more effective at lowering HIV infection rates and healthcare costs .
Using a conservative model , the British medical journal Lancet estimated that the US would have recorded net savings of $ 500 million if it had implemented a national syringe exchange program between 1987-1995 .
Similarly , an international survey found that HIV infection among intravenous drug users decreased by 5.8 % per year in cities with syringe exchange programs , and increased by 5.9 % per year in cities without such programs .
No major study has shown that syringe exchange programs increase rates of drug use .
Indeed , studies in the US , Australia , and elsewhere show that drug treatment rates tend to remain steady or rise , because syringe exchange participants gain greater access to rehabilitative care .
UN agencies such as the Commission on Narcotic Drugs or the Office on Drugs and Crime are not mandated to prescribe specific drug strategies .
However , their narrowly focused anti-drug stance strongly influences the policies and practices of member nations .
Many individual governments , obsessed with compliance , are unable or unwilling to consider the negative public health effects of harsh anti-drug policies .
International institutions chose to look the other way in the 1990 &apos;s as HIV / AIDS killed millions in Africa , infecting more than 25 % of the population in some countries .
Because of similar ignorance , this terrible epidemic now looms over the former Soviet Union and other regions .
Have we really learned nothing ?
It is not too late for international and national policymakers to reconsider their strategies .
In defiance of the UN conventions , some countries have adopted more pragmatic approaches to dealing with drug use and HIV .
By treating drug use first and foremost as a problem of public health , nations can fight the spread of HIV far more effectively .
To achieve this , they should take the following steps :
· Adopt anti-discrimination and equal-protection laws to guarantee the civil liberties and human rights of drug users and people living with HIV ;
· Acknowledge drug use as a public health issue , not a law-and-order issue , with government policies reflecting this reality ;
· Explicitly legalize needle exchange and the use of methadone and other &quot; substitute &quot; medications for treatment ;
· Create national programs that encompass a full range of pragmatic , inclusive , and accessible harm reduction services , from education and drug treatment to substitution therapy and needle exchange ;
· Include drug users and their advocates in developing policies on drug use at both international and national levels .
Continuing resistance to calls to restructure anti-drug strategies and goals will only worsen the HIV epidemic and contribute to the deaths of millions of vulnerable people .
Dump the Lisbon Agenda
As soon as he takes office as President of the European Commission , Durao Barroso - Portugal &apos;s former Prime Minister - should devote urgent attention to restoring order and focus to the European Union &apos;s economic policies .
The thickest file on his desk concerns the Lisbon agenda , an ambitious programme approved in 2000 by the EU heads of state and government with the goal of making the Union &quot; the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy &quot; by 2010 .
All major fields of economic policy are covered : innovation and entrepreneurship , welfare reform and social inclusion , skills and employability , gender equality , labour and product market liberalisation , and &quot; sustainable &quot; development .
All of these are worthy goals , to be sure , but they belong intrinsically to the sphere of national political decisions .
Indeed , under the European Treaties , the Union has no competence to enact legislation and policy in these domains , nor powers to enforce them .
But the European Council , spurred by the European Commission , invented a new policy approach - called &quot; open coordination &quot; - in order to impinge on these fields .
Open coordination entails the definition of common goals at the EU level , voluntary compliance by the member states , and peer review of results within the European Council .
Inevitably , open coordination has failed to deliver on its promises .
Moreover , the delusion that the European Council can somehow call growth and productivity into being has provided a diversion to national politicians who are unwilling to push for unpopular decisions back home .
My first suggestion to Barroso , therefore , is to scrap the Lisbon agenda .
Only this will make it clear that responsibility for national economic performance lies with national policy-makers .
This brings me to the subject of macroeconomic coordination at the EU level .
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged a simple policy framework for economic and monetary union .
Monetary policy was centralized and entrusted to an independent central bank , while fiscal policy was left to the member states .
National governments were made subject - under the excessive-deficit procedure - to the twin constraints that fiscal deficits should not exceed 3 % of GDP and government debt should remain below 60 % of GDP ( or at least tend towards that value ) .
Later on , the Stability and Growth Pact added a requirement that , over the medium term , government accounts should be &quot; close to balance . &quot;
Essentially , this aimed to prevent irresponsible budgetary policies after the euro &apos;s launch , while leaving sufficient room for cyclical oscillations of the deficit within the 3 % limit .
The credibility of this apparatus was badly damaged by the November 2003 public controversy between the Commission and the Ecofin Council over the application of the excessive-deficit procedure to France and Germany .
This does not mean that it should be abandoned .
On the contrary , a common external constraint on fiscal behavior is needed as a joint safeguard against an unsustainable accumulation of public debt that could affect financial stability and inflation throughout the EU - a risk aggravated by the impact of aging populations on pension systems .
Such a constraint also provides a welcome anchor for domestic decision-making in member states with weaker political systems .
But the system needs to be reviewed .
I would not listen to those who advocate excluding investment from fiscal deficits : this would only offer new incentives for creative accounting and unsustainable accumulation of debt .
Instead , the emphasis should shift from annual deficits to debt sustainability .
The debt criterion , for example , could be supplemented by a limit on the ( trend ) growth rate of public spending , which would be kept below that of nominal GDP .
The Commission &apos;s powers to initiate action when there is a risk of excessive deficits should be strengthened - provided , of course , that the Commission never again forgets that surveillance of national policies is a task that requires political judgment and cannot be left to accountants and lawyers .
Finally , top priority should be assigned to completing the Single European Market , in which the Union has powerful legal instruments to pry open markets and sustain competition .
The best therapy for reinvigorating growth is both direct , by increasing competitive pressure , and indirect , by triggering the necessary adaptation in national employment , welfare , and education policies .
The job is far from finished .
State aid to ailing companies remains ubiquitous , and common rules designed to ensure free circulation of goods and services are not fully respected by the member states - public procurement and energy markets being prime examples .
Moreover , most markets for services - securities trading , wholesale and retail distribution , business services , and local utilities - remain sheltered from competition and free circulation rules .
Empirical evidence indicates that these distortions in the market for services , which account for about two thirds of GDP , underlie most of the EU &apos;s productivity gap with the United States .
In recent years the European Council has not devoted sufficient attention to these tasks , which require full and continuing commitment by member states to transpose and implement Community directives .
All too often , the Commission has favored enacting new legislation and creating new spending programs over the effective administration of what already exists .
So Barroso should forget the high-flying platitudes of the Lisbon agenda and focus instead on effective completion of the Single Market and keeping the member states &apos; fiscal policies in order .
Let national governments take responsibility for their countries &apos; economic performance .
The Emotional Clash of Civilizations
Throughout the so-called &quot; war on terror , &quot; the notion of a &quot; clash of civilization &quot; between Islam and the West has usually been dismissed as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded .
Instead , the most common interpretation has been that the world has entered a new era characterized by conflict &quot; within &quot; a particular civilization , namely Islam , with fundamentalist Muslims as much at war against moderates as against the West .
The strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear , ambitious , and easily summarized : democratization .
If the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem , bringing democracy to the &quot; Greater Middle-East would be the solution , and it was the historical duty of the United States , as the most powerful and moral nation , to bring about that necessary change .
The status quo was untenable .
Implementing democracy , with or without regime change , was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism .
Today , Iraq may be on the verge of civil war between Shiites and Sunnis .
Iran under a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly towards possessing a nuclear capacity .
A free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine , and the unfortunate episode of the Danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between Islam and the West .
All of these developments are paving the way to new interpretations .
Rather than a &quot; clash of civilizations , &quot; we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict , which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability .
Indeed , it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict .
There is a clash within Islam , which , if the violence in Iraq spreads to neighboring countries , risks causing regional destabilization .
There is also a clash that is best described not as being between Islam and the West , but between the secularized world and a growing religious one .
At an even deeper and atavistic level , there is an emotional clash between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation .
It would be a gross oversimplification to speak , as some are doing , of a clash between civilization and barbarism .
In reality , we are confronted with a widening divide over the role of religion , which runs between the West ( with the US being a complicated exception ) and much of the rest of the world ( the most notable exception being China ) , but particularly the Islamic world .
The divide reflects how religion defines an individual &apos;s identity within a society .
At a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere , we Europeans have largely forgotten our ( violent and intolerant ) religious past , and we have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in other peoples &apos; daily lives .
In some ways , &quot; they &quot; are our own buried past and , with a combination of ignorance , prejudice , and , above all , fear , &quot; we &quot; are afraid that &quot; they &quot; could define our future .
We live in a secular world , where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery , while others see religion as their supreme goal , if not their last hope .
They have tried everything , from nationalism to regionalism , from communism to capitalism .
Since everything has failed , why not give God a chance ?
Globalization may not have created these layers of conflicts , but it has accelerated them by making the differences more visible and palpable .
In our globalized age , we have lost the privilege -- and , paradoxically , the virtue -- of ignorance .
We all see how others feel and react , but without the minimal historical and cultural tools necessary to decipher those reactions .
Globalization has paved the way to a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions -- and of ignorance .
This clash of emotions is exacerbated in the case of Islam .
In the Arab world , in particular , Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main losers , the worst victims , of a new and unjust international system .
From that standpoint , the Israel-Palestine conflict is exemplary .
It has become an obsession .
It is not so much that Arabs and Muslims really care about the Palestinians .
On the contrary , the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades .
In reality , for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order , to represent their political malaise , and to embody the perceived impossibility of their being masters of their destiny .
In the eyes of the Arabs ( and some other Muslims ) , Israel &apos;s strength and resilience is a direct consequence of their own weakness , divisions , and corruption .
The majority of Arabs may not support al-Qaeda , but they do not oppose it with all their heart .
Instead , there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Hood , whose actions , while impossible to condone officially , have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity .
Here , perhaps , is the real clash of civilizations : the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim , particularly Arab , culture of humiliation .
It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of so wide an emotional divide , and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcoming it .
But that will be difficult , for transcending the emotional clash of civilizations presupposes an opening to the &quot; other &quot; that neither side may yet be ready to undertake .
Globalization and Anti-Americanism
Anti-American sentiments are rising around the world .
American Democrats say that President Bush &apos;s policies have squandered America &apos;s attractiveness .
Republicans reply that America is bound to be resented because of its size and its association with globalization .
Anti-Americanism , they say , will persist because some people see America as a cultural threat .
I believe that such views lack historical perspective .
Contrary to conventional wisdom , globalization is not homogenizing and Americanizing the cultures of the world .
Although the United States is at the forefront of the current information revolution , which is creating many similarities in social and cultural habits ( such as television viewing or Internet use ) that are attributed to Americanization , correlation is not causation .
To see why , imagine a country that introduced computers and communications at a rapid rate in a world in which America did not exist .
You would still expect major social and cultural changes from such modernization .
Of course , because the US exists and is at the forefront of the information revolution , there is a degree of Americanization , but that is likely to diminish over the course of the twenty-first century as technology spreads and local cultures modernize in their own ways .
Historical proof that globalization does not necessarily mean homogenization can be seen in Japan , a country that deliberately isolated itself from earlier waves of globalization .
In the middle of the nineteenth century , Japan became the first Asian country to embrace globalization , and to borrow successfully from the world without losing its uniqueness .
During the Meiji Restoration , Japan searched broadly for tools and innovations that would allow it to become a major power rather than a victim of Western imperialism .
It sent young people to the West for education .
Its delegations scoured the world for ideas in science , technology , and industry .
In the political realm , Meiji reformers were well aware of Anglo-American ideas and institutions , but deliberately turned to German models because they were deemed more suitable to a country with an emperor .
The lesson that Japan teaches the rest of the world is not simply that an Asian country can compete , but that after a century and a half of globalization , it is possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture .
More fundamentally , the image of a homogenizing America reflects a mistakenly static view of culture .
Efforts to portray local cultures as unchanging often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than descriptions of reality .
As the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has put it , those who argue in favor of cultural identity and against globalization , betray a stagnant attitude towards culture that is not borne out by historical fact .
Do we know of any cultures that have remained unchanged through time ?
To find any of them one has to travel to the small , primitive , magico-religious communities made up of people … who due to their primitive condition , become progressively more vulnerable to exploitation and extermination .
Vibrant cultures are constantly changing and borrowing from other cultures - and that borrowing is not always from the US .
For example , many more countries turned to Canada than to America as an example for framing constitutions in the aftermath of the Cold War .
Globalization is also a two-edged sword .
In some areas , there is not only a backlash against American cultural imports , but an effort to change American culture itself .
Capital punishment may now be supported by a majority of Americans , but the death penalty is regarded as an egregious violation of human rights across Europe - indeed , across much of the world .
American environmental attitudes toward climate change or genetic modification of food bring similar criticism .
More subtly , America &apos;s openness to immigration both enriches and changes American culture .
Finally , globalization and the information revolution may reinforce rather than reduce cultural diversity .
Some French commentators express fear that in a world of Internet global marketing , there will no longer be room for a culture that cherishes hundreds of different types of cheese .
But on the contrary , the Internet allows dispersed customers to come together in a way that encourages niche markets , including hundreds of Web sites dedicated only to cheese .
The Internet also allows people to establish a more diverse set of political communities .
The use of the Welsh language in Britain and Gaelic in Ireland is greater today than fifty years ago .
Britain , Belgium , and Spain , among others in Europe , have devolved more power to local regions .
The global information age may strengthen rather than weaken local cultures .
Economic and social globalization does produce superficial similarities in T-shirt logos and soft drink brands , but an underlying cultural diversity will remain .
American culture is now prominent , and it contributes to America &apos;s attractiveness - its &quot; soft power &quot; - in many , but not all , areas .
At the same time , immigrants , ideas , and events outside America &apos;s borders are changing American culture within the borders of the US .
As globalization spreads technical capabilities , and information technology allows broader participation in global communications , American economic and cultural preponderance may diminish .
A little less dominance may mean a little less anxiety about Americanization , fewer complaints about American arrogance , and less intensity in the anti-American backlash .
The US may have less control in the future , but it may find itself living in a world somewhat more congenial to its basic values of democracy , free markets , individual liberties , and human rights .
Why America Must Rejoin the World
The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September 11 , 2001 , profoundly changed the US , spawning a new focus on foreign policy .
The Bush administration &apos;s new national security strategy , issued in September 2002 , identifies the combination of terrorism , rogue states , and weapons of mass destruction as the primary threat confronting America .
Most people agree with the new focus of American foreign policy , but debate the means by which it is carried out .
Is the threat so great that America must act alone , or should the US act only with the support of international institutions , even if that holds the country back ?
Events in Iraq illustrate this debate , but it has deeper roots .
In his 2000 election campaign , George W. Bush said about America , &quot; If we are an arrogant nation , they &apos;ll view us that way , but if we &apos;re a humble nation , they &apos;ll respect us . &quot;
He was right , but unfortunately many of America &apos;s friends saw the first eight months of his administration as arrogantly concerned with narrow American interests , focused on military power , and dismissive of treaties , norms , and multilateralism .
The administration &apos;s peremptory announcement that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change was &quot; dead &quot; contributed to a reaction from other countries that cost the US its seat on the UN Human Rights Commission .


September 11
The new unilateralists make a mistake in focusing too heavily on military power alone .
True , America &apos;s military power--backed up by a budget equivalent to the next eight countries combined -is essential to global stability , and an essential part of the response to terrorism .
But the metaphor of war should not blind us to the fact that suppressing terrorism will take years of patient , unspectacular civilian cooperation with other countries in areas such as intelligence sharing , police work , tracing financial flows , and cooperation among customs officials .
Military success in Afghanistan addressed the easiest part of the problem .
Al Qaeda retains cells in some fifty countries .
Rather than proving the unilateralists &apos; point , the partial nature of the success in Afghanistan illustrates the continuing need for cooperation .
Similarly , it was much easier to win the war in Iraq than to win the peace .
The problem for Americans in the 21
The US lacks both the international and domestic prerequisites to resolve conflicts internal to other societies , and to monitor and control transnational transactions that threaten Americans at home .
On many of today &apos;s key issues , such as international financial stability , drug smuggling , the spread of diseases , or global climate change , military power is ineffective .
Indeed , its use can be counterproductive .
America must instead mobilize international coalitions to address these shared threats and challenges .
The willingness of others to cooperate depends in part on their own self-interest , but also on the attractiveness of American positions .
That power to attract is what I call &quot; soft power . &quot;
It means that others want what you want , and there is less need to use carrots and sticks to make others do what you want .
Hard power grows out of a country &apos;s military and economic might .
Soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country &apos;s culture , ideals , and policies .
Hard power will always remain vital , but soft power will become increasingly important in dealing with transnational issues whose resolution requires multilateral cooperation .
To be sure , no large country can afford to be purely multilateralist , and sometimes the US must take the lead , as it did in Afghanistan .
But in Iraq , President Bush should have followed his father &apos;s example and built a broad international coalition .
Now , as his administration returns to the UN to seek a new resolution that will enable other countries to contribute troops and resources for peacekeeping and reconstruction in Iraq , he is paying the price for the way he went to war .
Granted , multilateralism can be used by smaller states to restrict American freedom of action , but this does not mean that it is not generally in American interests .
By embedding US policies in multilateral frameworks , America can make its disproportionate power more legitimate and acceptable .
Even well intentioned Americans are not immune to Lord Acton &apos;s famous warning that power tends to corrupt .
Learning to listen to others and to define US interests broadly to include global interests will be crucial to American soft power and whether others see the American preponderance as benign or not .
The paradox of American power is that the largest power since Rome cannot achieve many of its objectives unilaterally in a global information age .
America needs to pay more attention to soft power and to multilateral cooperation .
That is the real lesson of September 11
Socialism or Global Division ?
For the first time in history , we have the knowledge , the technology , and the wealth to design a different world .
We have the resources to &quot; make poverty history . &quot;
But , though we have the power to change the world , we are not taking the steps needed to do so .
In 2000 , the world &apos;s governments adopted the United Nations Millennium Development Goals , which aim to halve global poverty by 2015 .
Yet the international community has lacked the political will needed to meet these basic responsibilities to humanity , causing people to lose faith in politics .
Unless we take action , our citizens will lose hope in the power of democracy -- or find hope in extremism , fundamentalism , and violence .
To restore people &apos;s trust not only in politics , but also in their own potential , our policies must guarantee responsible governance and institutions that work for and with responsible citizens .
As the largest political organization in the world , the Socialist International can unite the world &apos;s citizens around a new global agenda to achieve these goals .
Our first challenge is to democratize globalization .
We must reconfigure globalization from the bottom-up , bringing in the two-thirds of the human race that is currently excluded from the process , on terms that reflect the socialist principles of inclusion , cultural diversity , and sustainable development .
How can citizens have a democratic say in world economic development when the IMF and World Bank work on the principle of &quot; one dollar , one vote &quot; ?
There can be no real democracy when we have a massive concentration of capital and power in the hands of the few ; when multinational corporations challenge the power of democratically elected representatives ; when organized criminals can buy off police officers , judges , and politicians ; when monopolization of the media erodes fundamental freedoms .
Democratizing globalization will take time .
But we can accelerate the process by strengthening regional cooperation and integration .
This calls for new channels of cooperation with progressive forces in other parts of the world -- in China , the United States , India , and the Arab world .
To tackle global problems , we need to strengthen and democratize international institutions like the United Nations .
But we need to look beyond reform of the Security Council and start creating a democratic global architecture that puts globalization at the service of citizens , not markets .
Today , the top priority for socialists is to re-establish a balance between economic productivity and social justice .
While we have some successful precedents , such as the Nordic model , it is difficult for nations to achieve this balance .
As capitalist markets give way to vast commercial networks , and as market economies become market societies , governments and unions are increasingly restricted in scope .
This has disempowered and divided our citizens .
Citizens of developed countries increasingly feel like mere objects of consumerism , while citizens of developing countries struggle for daily survival .
In both cases , but in different ways , people feel impoverished .
To be sure , we have very diverse societies , but we also face new forms of inequality .
Lack of labor standards in one part of the world undermines the social welfare of workers in other parts of the world .
Mass migration from poor countries has created fear and xenophobia in richer countries , especially among the working class .
Similarly , free trade has turned farmers and service workers in the developing and developed world against each other .
Environmental concerns have become a &quot; blame game . &quot;
The developed world fears the depletion of vital resources by the developing world , which in turn blames the developed world for destroying the environment in pursuit of profit .
To bridge these divides , we must rethink the nature of employment in an increasingly automated , borderless , and mobile global economy .
As capital is globalized , so basic labor standards should be global .
Forced labor , child labor , and discrimination in the workplace must be eliminated .
We must also make our own politics more democratic .
We must fight exclusion from our political parties , just as we fight exclusion in our societies .
This means welcoming migrants and minorities , creating more opportunities for women and the disabled , and empowering citizens through education and participation .
Empowering citizens means giving them both the power to decide and the knowledge to decide well .
In PASOK , the Greek Socialist party that I lead , we are undertaking far-reaching reforms in this direction .
Likewise , the goal of the Socialist International is a world governed not by free markets , but by free people .
The Indian Tortoise and the Chinese Hare
&quot; India everywhere &quot; was the theme at this year &apos;s World Economic Forum .
In the West , there is so much focus on China that India &apos;s achievements are often acknowledged only as an afterthought .
As if to underscore the point that political stability must triumph in the long run , the Indians plastered Swiss buses with the banner : &quot; India : The World &apos;s Fastest Growing Democracy . &quot;
The India media blitz was a huge success .
In Davos , speaker after speaker touted the idea that even if China is ahead now , over the longer run , the race between Asia &apos;s two giants is a toss-up .
For a few days at least , India &apos;s emergence as a superpower on par with China was taken as a fait accompli .
But what is the reality in the race between economies with more than a billion people each ?
On the surface , China has opened up quite a lead on India .
Twenty-five years ago , at the start of the contemporary wave of globalization , national output in India and China was about the same .
Now , by any measure , China is more than twice as rich .
But the real difference is not so much that successful Chinese are doing better than successful Indians .
After all , the Indian elite are world-beaters , as Lakshmi Mittal &apos;s bold $ 22 billion bid for French steelmaker Arcelor shows .
No , the real difference -- whether we like to admit it or not -- is that China &apos;s communist government has succeeded in globalizing a much larger share of its population than India &apos;s democratic government has managed to do .
Not that China is exactly egalitarian .
It is only along the coast , home to roughly one in three Chinese citizens , that most people can be said to have really joined the twenty-first century .
Much of rural China is still miserable , with 150 million people effectively unemployed and health and education standards often befitting an earlier century .
But caste-bound India &apos;s record of exclusion is worse .
Perhaps only one in five persons are integrated into the global economy .
For every call center employee , there are many more people still eking out a subsistence living on the land .
Whereas China probably has about 450 million people in its globalized economy , India has at most 200-250 million .
It is this difference , more than anything else , that sets the two economies apart .
What can India do to close the gap ?
Its biggest shortcoming is its lack of roads , bridges , ports , and other infrastructure , where the contrast with China is just stunning .
If your products can &apos;t get to the global economy , you cannot conquer it .
Over the past five years , China has multiplied its highway system five-fold .
Its 50,000 kilometers of new roads are built to handle even large aircraft , which is more than one can say about some of the runways at India &apos;s shambolic airports .
It is not just a matter of money -- India &apos;s central bank is rolling in cash , which it has mainly invested in low-yield foreign treasury bills .
The real problem is that China &apos;s authoritarian system faces little opposition when it decides to bulldoze a shantytown that stands in the way of a new airport .
India &apos;s government , by contrast , has neither the power nor the inclination to trample over poor people to make rich people richer .
Unfortunately , without infrastructure , the 800 million-plus Indians who have not yet &quot; made it &quot; don &apos;t have a chance .
India will never be able to create enough jobs in services alone ; it must be able to compete in low-end manufacturing areas as well .
Without better infrastructure , the majority of India &apos;s citizens will remain frozen out of globalization .
So , is the idea that India &apos;s economy could overtake China &apos;s hopeless romanticism ?
Not necessarily , if only because the areas where India excels , notably services , have far higher potential margins than manufacturing .
Here , the Chinese , hampered by a vastly inferior legal system , will not be able to compete easily .
Western companies are far more inclined to trust Indian firms with sensitive financial information or patents than they are in the case of China .
Foreign companies know that if they outsource any high-tech process to China , they might as well publish their blueprints on the Internet .
India also has a much better developed financial system than China , an advantage that will be increasingly important as the two countries develop .
Command and control financing ( &quot; directed lending , &quot; as economists call it ) works well when it comes to building bridges ; it is a lot less effective when it comes to choosing what companies deserve to survive .
The challenge for the Indians , and , indeed , for other emerging markets like Brazil , Russia , and Mexico , is that they need to find ways to broaden the successful sectors of their economies without strangling them .
If India is to ever catch up with China , it must globalize more of its citizens , through better provision of health , education and infrastructure .
Only then will we truly start seeing &quot; India everywhere . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Skeptical G8 Partners
Poor oil-rich Russia .
It is trying so hard to have its turn as chair of the elite Group of Eight countries taken seriously .
President Vladimir Putin , perhaps hoping to elevate the presidential summit talks in St. Petersburg in July , has laid out an ambitious agenda .
He plans to lead his colleagues in erudite conversations about education , infectious diseases , and -- to make sure that no one dozes off -- &quot; energy security . &quot;
And what has Putin gotten for his efforts ?
Not much .
The Bush administration , led by Vice President Dick Cheney ( but with his boss &apos;s explicit approval ) , recently accused Russia of backsliding into its old &quot; evil empire &quot; ways .
Putin shot back , portraying the United States as &quot; Comrade Wolf , &quot; ready to pounce on any nation that leaves itself vulnerable .
Suspense seems to be building around how Bush and Putin will greet each other when they meet in St. Petersburg .
Europeans , for their part , are still hysterical about getting caught up in the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute that left their pipelines dry for a few days at the beginning of this year .
They see discussing &quot; energy security &quot; with Russia as akin to chatting about water safety with Comrade Crocodile .
Of course , people who really want to be unkind will point out the absurdity of Russia &apos;s membership in a club that includes the giant economies of US , Germany , Japan , England , France , Italy , and ( less so ) Canada .
Why wasn &apos;t Chinese president Hu Jintao , whose country &apos;s economy is the world &apos;s second largest ( when measured at world prices ) , given a seat at the table instead of Putin ?
After all , even with all its energy resources , and even with today &apos;s sky-high oil and gas prices , Russia &apos;s national income is only about the size of Greater Los Angeles .
Perhaps what Putin needs to do is stop suffering all the criticisms and go on the offensive .
He could start by pointing out to his smugly democratic counterparts that he is probably more popular in Russia today than any of them are in their own countries .
He might actually win a fair election tomorrow ( not that he would ever risk finding out ) .
Few of the others could make the same claim with a straight face .
Of course , Putin &apos;s success over the past few years in killing off any semblance of a free press -- and when an ex-KGB man &quot; kills off &quot; a free press , it is not just a figure of speech -- has helped mute open opposition .
Even so , Putin does seem genuinely popular among a public longing for a leader who can anchor their country without sinking it .
Putin might also argue that Russia &apos;s fiscal position is far stronger that of the other G8 members .
Yes , it helps that Siberia turned out to be a giant oil well , with the government sucking up much of the money .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is balancing his country &apos;s books , too , for now .
But , to be fair , oil is not the whole story .
Most economists advocate rich countries &apos; replacing their complex and antiquated tax codes with a simple low flat tax , and they bemoan the fact that so few countries have tried it .
Putin , however , implemented such a policy a few years ago , and the results have been nothing short of miraculous .
Of course , the other G8 leaders might be less enamored of some of Russia &apos;s other approaches to addressing budget problems .
Most G8 countries seem incapable of achieving the political consensus required to take necessary steps such as raising the retirement age or significantly cutting the indexation of benefits to inflation .
Russia , by contrast , has essentially abandoned its pensioners by inflating away the value of their incomes .
Indeed , many of the elderly in rural Russia are forced to sustain themselves by growing potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to till .
That is , assuming they survive at all : since the fall of the Berlin Wall , Russian male life expectancy has plummeted from 65 years to around 60 years .
There is growing evidence that the stress of transition is the leading cause of death , even above big killers in postcommunist Russia such as alcohol , murder , and AIDS .
Should Putin tell his colleagues that they , too , could balance their countries &apos; intergenerational accounts by starving the elderly ?
So perhaps Putin had better not try to push his country &apos;s accomplishments too far .
Maybe the best plan is simply to let the vodka flow and hope for a round of smiles in the photo ops .
In any case , when Putin tells his guests how they can pay Russia more to improve their own &quot; energy security , &quot; he may finally get the respect that he craves .
The Economy of Fear
The global economy seems to be walking on water , shrugging off soaring oil prices , policy paralysis in Europe , unsustainable borrowing by the United States , and record housing prices .
Is it because , as G-8 leaders would have us believe , investors are in a buoyant mood , confident in their leaders &apos; stewardship of the global economy ?
Or are we being governed by a pathology of fear , fed by events such as the recent London bombings , that is holding down long-term interest rates thereby covering up a host of simmering problems ?
The role of phenomenally low long-term ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates in covering up a multitude of weaknesses in the global economy is all too apparent .
Soaring house prices worldwide are propping up consumer demand in many countries , and , according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund , continually falling long-term interest rates explain two-thirds or more of the global price rise .
Europe has benefited less , but its economies would be a lot worse off if long-term interest rates climbed back to their 25-year average .
Similarly , Latin America has been booming in recent years , despite high debt burdens and a mixed record of policy reform .
Low long-term interest rates have kept the region &apos;s debts manageable , while high consumer demand has helped bid up prices for the region &apos;s commodity exports .
Why hasn &apos;t the huge spike in oil prices cut the world to its knees , as it has on so many other occasions ?
Again , the answer is low interest rates .
Ordinarily , a sharp rise in oil prices quickly translates into higher inflation expectations , followed by rising interest rates at all maturities .
But this time , even as the US Federal Reserve keeps hiking its short-term lending rate to keep inflation in line , long-term interest rates -- which are far more important -- have been magically declining .
Indeed , America has been the single biggest beneficiary of this freakish low-interest-rate environment , with everyone seeming to borrow money like it is going out of style .
Homeowners , backed by rising house prices , are piling up debt .
The Federal government has thrown fiscal prudence out the window .
The country as a whole is absorbing an astounding three-quarters of global excess savings .
But , as long as interest rates remain low and growth high , Americans can laugh at predictions that their excesses are laying the seeds of ruin .
But if low long-term interest rates are helping so many economies walk on water , why are rates so low , and will they stay that way ?
Perhaps the situation is far more fragile than many policymakers would have us believe .
Perhaps people have come to feel less , not more , secure about their long-term future , either because of fears about terrorism , a global pandemic , or a severe rash of financial crises .
I am not claiming that investors are hysterical , just that they may have become a bit more concerned about the long-term outlook .
As a consequence , they are crowding into bonds and debt instruments that they view , rightly or wrongly , as safe vehicles .
Other convincing explanations are lacking .
To be sure , emerging markets have been on an unusual savings spree , rebuilding reserves and improving balance sheets , but nobody expects this to go on forever .
Even US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ordinarily the Oracle of Delphi on interest-rate matters , has declared the current situation &quot; a conundrum . &quot;
History suggests that the global technology boom has yet to play itself out , with US productivity gains likely to radiate out across the world , raising growth rates everywhere .
Ordinarily , rapid global growth translates into high long-term interest rates -- that is , unless , deep down , people have become nervous .
Suppose investors are worried about a small chance of catastrophe over the next five to ten years .
( According to experts on nuclear terrorism and pandemics , the dangers are real . )
Suppose investors believe that growth will probably continue to be strong , but that maybe -- just maybe -- things will fall apart .
In this case , it is entirely possible to have very low interest rates co-exist with strong growth .
True , some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950 &apos;s and early 1960 &apos;s , when Europe , the US , and Japan prospered , but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth .
Since that was a golden era for global growth , why worry if we are seeing the same phenomenon today ?
What the optimists forget is that the 1950 &apos;s and 1960 &apos;s were also a period of massive insecurity .
Many people realistically feared the outbreak of World War III -- and with good reason , according to many historians .
Back then , the specter of the Apocalypse helped keep borrowing cheap .
Happily , investors &apos; darkest fears were not realized , and we can only hope for the same .
But if insecurity is a major undercurrent of today &apos;s record-low interest rates , then G-8 leaders should be more cautious in their self-congratulation .
Investors &apos; collective psychology is notoriously fragile .
If they ever calm down , interest rates will shoot up , and that could well bring the global economy &apos;s simmering imbalances to a raging boil .
Israel &apos;s Political Earthquake
Israeli politics is undergoing its most dramatic changes in 30 years .
The realignment of parties and leaders is all the more remarkable because the latest developments -- Ariel Sharon &apos;s decision to leave the ruling Likud party , the defeat of Shimon Peres as the Labor party &apos;s chairman , and Labor &apos;s withdrawal from Sharon &apos;s grand coalition government -- were utterly unexpected .
So it is all the more important to comprehend the significance of these changes for the future of Israel , the region , and the Arab-Israeli conflict .
Israel &apos;s political system is , to put it simply , coming to the end of its second era .
From independence in 1948 until 1977 , the Labor party was dominant , before giving way to an opposition coalition of conservative , nationalist , and centrist parties allied in the Likud bloc .
Since then , the two parties have taken turns in power , sometimes in grand coalitions and often in partnership with smaller parties .
On the surface , party competition has been between &quot; left &quot; and &quot; right , &quot; or &quot; hawks &quot; and &quot; doves . &quot;
The truth , of course , is more complex .
Social class and economic issues , overshadowed by the persistence of more existential concerns -- physical security and the continued existence of the state -- have played a much less important role in Israel than in other societies .
Here , the political divide could be defined as &quot; optimists &quot; versus &quot; pessimists . &quot;
The former , as in Labor , believed that some day a force would emerge among Arabs and Palestinians ready to make peace on a reasonable basis ; the latter , as in Likud , were more doubtful .
For years , the argument remained an abstraction , a debate over what might happen in the future , until the Oslo agreement with the PLO in 1993 put the competing perspectives to the test .
Since 2000 , when PLO leader Yasir Arafat rejected a political settlement and instead launched a five-year war of terrorism , there have been few optimists left .
The subsequent intellectual realignment in Israel has given rise to a new national consensus .
It is now generally accepted that , as the left has always insisted , Israel should be ready to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and accept a Palestinian state in exchange for real peace .
But it is also accepted that , as the right has always maintained , there is no partner ready to make real peace .
In this context , Sharon gained two landslide election victories as a hardliner , but implemented a moderate policy , including a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip .
This is where Israel stands today , facing a political upheaval fueled by two developments .
First , Sharon moved the Likud to the center , making it the hegemonic party , while destroying every stereotype about his personality , methods , and worldview .
For the same reason , though , many within Likud view Sharon -- who helped found the party -- as a traitor .
Sharon now needs to institutionalize his reforms , even if he now needs to establish another party to do so .
Second , the Labor party has proven politically bankrupt , with its only conceivable leader being the 82-year-old Shimon Peres and its anachronistic dovish optimism the source of much ridicule .
As a result -- and helped by low voter turnout -- the party &apos;s leadership primary was won by Amir Peretz , an outsider and populist who wants to revitalize Labor by putting social and economic issues at the forefront , which means withdrawing from the national unity coalition with Likud .
Despite having to form a new party , Sharon will probably win the next election , which he has called for February .
Peretz &apos;s strategy may draw voters from other parties on the left , but Labor will most likely lose centrist voters ( and those for whom national security is paramount ) to Sharon .
Paradoxically , all of this will mean both a great deal in principle and perhaps little in practice .
With Sharon enjoying a strong public mandate for a moderate policy , Israel will be more ready than ever to make a deal with the Palestinians , Syria , and the Arab world in general for a comprehensive diplomatic solution to the conflict .
Yet , given the chaos and paralysis that increasingly characterize Palestinian politics , that opportunity will go untaken .
The rising power of Hamas , which openly proclaims its strategy of increasing terrorism and its goal of destroying Israel , reinforces that trend .
The same can be said of Syria , whose hardline government is turning toward a dangerously adventurous militancy .
Sharon might decide on partial withdrawals and dismantling of settlements on the West Bank .
But it is now widely recognized that such changes are a response to dim prospects of real progress toward peace .
Holding onto territory as a bargaining chip makes less sense if there is no one with whom to bargain .
Instead , Israel will continue to prioritize its own security , strengthening its defenses against terrorism and consolidating control over the relatively small portions of the West Bank that it intends to claim as part of an eventual diplomatic settlement .
A byproduct of this strategy , combined with ongoing Palestinian attacks , has been growing international sympathy with Israel .
That , too , could continue if the current political realignment proves permanent , enabling Sharon to win over the center and even moderate left for his program .
Nothing is assured , of course .
The still popular Benjamin Netanyahu could emerge as a powerful rival on his right , and Peretz might yet shape Labor into a serious contender on his left .
Nevertheless , the national consensus has shifted , shaking all assumptions about Israeli politics .
The February elections will put those assumptions to their severest test in decades .
The Climate Change Agreement : Bridging Gaps through Science
Securing the Future at the Evian Summit
The paradox of our time is the great power of the world &apos;s richest countries to do good , but their seeming compulsion to miss every opportunity to do so .
The US stands as the supreme example of this : a country that devotes $ 450 billion per year to military spending allocates only $ 12 billion per year to development assistance for poor countries .
It can bomb Somalia , Afghanistan , and Iraq , but seems ill-equipped to help these places develop .
Europe is little better , paralyzed as it is by internal divisions and budget deficits .
Next week &apos;s G-8 summit in Evian , France is a chance to make a fresh start .
For the one billion people represented at the G-8 Summit , life is extremely good in comparison with the rest of the planet , with average incomes at $ 25,000 per person or more and life expectancy around 80 years .
For about three billion people in the world today , including China , much of India , and most of East Asia , economic development is proceeding reasonably well , even if it displays a lot of ups and downs ( most recently , the shock of the SARS epidemic ) .
Positive trends are also seen in Brazil and Mexico .
But for the world &apos;s remaining two billion people , life remains desperate .
For roughly one billion people , bare survival is nothing short of precarious .
Millions die each year because they lack access to medicines , food , safe drinking water , and basic sanitation .
Their life expectancy is often less than 50 years , and is falling in many places .
The G-8 could end the suffering of the world &apos;s poorest billion people if it adopted realistic measures to solve their problems .
They fail to do so not only because they are greedy , but also because they are scared .
They think that global poverty is inevitable and too expensive to solve .
But they can solve the problems of the world &apos;s poorest--with relatively little effort and with no noticeable negative impact on their own standard of living .
The biggest problem areas are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa , the Andean region , and Central Asia .
Other pockets of extreme poverty , in China and India , are on the path of amelioration due to these two giants &apos; rapid economic growth .
But the problems in sub-Saharan Africa , the Andes , and Central Asia are not solving themselves .
These regions are trapped in poverty .
The worst situation , by far , is in Africa .
The US government believes that these countries have only themselves to blame for their poverty .
But this is the ignorant boasting of a rich country that fails to comprehend the situation on the ground .
Africa is trapped in poverty for deep-seated reasons .
It suffers from endemic malaria , which is like a SARS pandemic that lasts for centuries , not for a few months .
It suffers from a climate prone to massive droughts and from soils depleted of nutrients .
It suffers from the fact that most of its population lives in the rural interior , without paved roads to reach ports and facilitate access to international trade .
Aside from a few countries in West Africa , it suffers from a serious shortage of energy resources , whether coal or oil or hydroelectric power .
The US never had to grapple with any one of these problems in the severity that they grip Africa .
The ultimate irony is that all of these deep problems are amenable to solutions , albeit solutions that require money .
That is where the G-8 should come in .
All that is required is for the G-8 leaders to commit , at Evian , to follow through on their previous promises , which for years have remained unfulfilled .
During the past three years , the world &apos;s leaders have promised concrete action to cut global poverty by one half by the year 2015 , in a series of commitments known as the Millennium Development Goals .
But only baby steps have followed .
The US increased foreign aid by perhaps $ 4 billion a year at the same time that it increased military spending by $ 150 billion annually and cut taxes by trillions of dollars .
Clearly , the US has the means to do vastly more to help the world &apos;s poor , if only it had the foresight .
Specifically , the G-8 leaders should commit to providing adequate financing for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria ; to raise food productivity in Africa through a new Green Revolution ; to ensure that all poor children have the opportunity to go to school ; and to ensure that poor people everywhere have access to clean drinking water and sanitation .
The total cost of this agenda , remarkably , would be much less than 1 % of the annual income of rich countries .
For the first time in history , the rich are so rich , and the poor so poor , that a tiny effort by the rich could end massive suffering .
The Evian Summit will clarify whether greed , ignorance , and the bombast of war have closed the eyes of the US entirely , and whether Europe and Japan will look inward rather than outward .
The Case for Slowing Population Growth
Global debates about population policy are confusing .
One side argues that rising human populations threaten our environment and prosperity .
Land , water , energy , and biodiversity all seem to be under greater stress than ever , and population growth appears to be a major source of that stress .
The other side of the debate , mainly in rich countries , argues that households are now having so few children that there won &apos;t be enough to care for aging parents .
Those who fret about population growth have the better argument .
Issues confronting Europe , Japan , and to a lesser extent the United States and some middle-income countries concerning aging populations are manageable .
Moreover , the benefits of slower population growth outweigh the adjustment costs .
By contrast , if global populations continue to rise rapidly , the stresses on the world &apos;s resources will worsen .
Governments should therefore refrain from deliberate policies to raise birthrates , even in places where birth rates are low .
Part of the confusion of the public debate reflects different population trends in different parts of the world .
The fastest population growth is taking place in the poorest regions .
Poor people , especially poor people living on farms , tend to have the most children ( often six or more per woman ) , and therefore the highest rates of population growth .
Poor farm families rely on their children for farm chores and for security when parents reach old age .
Poor families lack access to contraception and family planning .
Finally , poor families have many children as a kind of insurance policy against high child mortality rates .
As a result of high fertility rates in Africa , the UN Population Division predicts a doubling of Africa &apos;s population from around 900 million today to around 1.8 billion in 2050 .
Rapidly growing populations are also young populations , because of the high number of children per household .
In Africa , the median age is now a mere 19 years and is projected to rise to around 28 years in 2050 .
In Europe , the trends run in the other direction .
The UN projects a decline in population to around 630 million in 2050 , from around 725 million people today .
With few children and longer life expectancy , the median age of the population rises sharply in this forecast , from 39 years in 2005 to around 48 years in 2050 .
For the world as a whole , population is expected to continue to grow by another 2.5 billion people from 2005 to 2050 .
All of that growth will be in the developing world : 1.3 billion more people in Asia , 900 million more in Africa , the rest in Latin America and other regions .
Adding another 2.5 billion people to the planet will put enormous strains not only on societies with rising populations , but on the entire planet .
Total energy use is soaring , reflecting the combined effect of rising per capita incomes - and thus rising per capita energy use - and population growth .
Higher energy use is already changing the world &apos;s climate in dangerous ways .
Furthermore , the strains of increased global populations , combined with income growth , are leading to rapid deforestation , depletion of fisheries , land degradation , and the loss of habitat and extinction of a vast number of animal and plant species .
Population growth in developing regions - especially Africa , India , and other parts of Asia - needs to slow .
Public policies can play an important role by extending access to family planning services to the poor , expanding social security systems , reducing child mortality through public health investments , and improving education and job opportunities for women .
A part of the European public , looking at Europe &apos;s looming population decline , wants to head in the other direction , promoting a return to larger families .
That would be a big mistake .
Advocates of faster European population growth worry that there won &apos;t be enough young workers to pay for public pensions .
But this concern can be met through increased saving by today &apos;s young and middle-aged as they prepare for retirement , and by working past the age of 65 .
These workers will reap large benefits from living in societies with stable or gradually declining populations .
Most obviously , they will spend much less in direct household expenditures to raise children .
They will also save on investments in new roads , power plants , schools , and other public services .
They will enjoy less congested cities and fewer environmental pressures on the countryside .
European economies will face lower costs in limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from energy use , leading to more effective control of climate change .
The quality of life , in short , will tend to improve as Europe &apos;s population declines in coming decades .
There is nothing radical in calling for slower population growth .
For tens of thousands of years , the human population tended to rise and fall without a substantial long-term trend .
Only in the past two centuries , with the rise of modern economic life , did the world &apos;s population soar , from around one billion people in 1820 to 6.3 billion today and around 9 billion by 2050 .
This explosive growth was made possible by huge advances in science and technology .
But this unprecedented growth has also put tremendous pressures on the planet .
We should intensify our efforts to slow population growth through voluntary means , and we should recognize that leveling off of the Earth &apos;s population now would add to human happiness and strengthen environmental sustainability later .
Are Foreign Investors Still Welcome ?
World flows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) have soared over the past two decades , from $ 40 billion in the early 1980 &apos;s to $ 900 billion last year .
The cumulative stock of FDI has reached close to $ 10 trillion , making it the most important mechanism for delivery of goods and services to foreign markets : sales by foreign affiliates total roughly $ 19 trillion , compared to world exports of $ 11 trillion .
At the same time , the liberalization of FDI regimes by virtually all countries has been a driving force of intra-firm trade -- the lifeblood of the emerging system of integrated international production and already around one-third of world trade .
But are the good times coming to an end ?
FDI can bring a range of benefits , but it also can have costs .
During the 1970 &apos;s , when the transnational corporations ( TNC &apos;s ) undertaking such investment caught the public eye , many governments believed that the costs of FDI outweighed its benefits , so they controlled it .
Led by the developed countries , the pendulum began to swing in the 1980 &apos;s .
Once viewed as part of the problem , FDI became part of the solution to economic growth and development .
Nothing exemplifies this more than changes in national FDI regimes .
As the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reports , of the 2,156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004 , 93 % were in the direction of creating a more hospitable environment for TNC &apos;s .
But there is a real danger that the pendulum is beginning to swing back , leading to a reversal of that liberalization process .
FDI in developed countries ( and increasingly in emerging markets ) often takes the form of cross-border mergers and acquisitions ( M &amp; amp ; A &apos;s ) .
Resistance to such M &amp; amp ; A &apos;s is becoming more frequent when they involve domestic firms that are regarded by politicians as &quot; national champions &quot; or important for national security , economic development , or cultural identity .
The growing involvement of private equity groups in M &amp; amp ; A activity implies additional controversy , as such transactions are typically regarded as being purely speculative .
In the name of &quot; economic patriotism , &quot; security , and other considerations , resistance to M &amp; amp ; A &apos;s is being codified in an increasing number of countries .
For example , a United States Senate committee recently sought to block the planned liberalization of foreign takeover rules for airlines , while Europe has enacted more restrictive takeover laws .
Moreover , governments are applying more strictly existing regulatory provisions concerning the vetting of takeovers by foreign firms .
This response is intertwined with a defensive reaction to the growing role of TNC &apos;s from emerging markets , the &quot; new kids on the block . &quot;
Established TNC &apos;s , and their home countries , will need to adjust to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the world market .
As we know from other contexts , adjustment to newcomers is not easy : compare , say , the reaction to the tie-up between France &apos;s Alcatel and America &apos;s Lucent to the bids by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Chevron or Mittal for Acelor .
Another type of defensive reaction -- this time to outward FDI -- may well arise once the offshoring of services gathers more speed .
All indications are that offshoring has reached the tipping point , and more of it will take place through FDI .
If home countries do not put in place the adjustment mechanisms to deal with the rapidly unfolding revolution in making service industry jobs tradable , a backlash against such outward FDI will become inevitable .
The growing unease with FDI is so far largely confined to developed countries .
But there are signs that it is spreading to emerging markets .
In the case of large-scale projects , some host countries are raising questions about the contracts that define their relationship with TNC &apos;s , and governments are reviewing such contracts because they believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that they did not get a fair deal .
Of the 219 known international arbitration cases concerning investment projects , some two-thirds were initiated during the past three years .
Approaches to FDI have changed in the past , and they can change again in the future , depending on how governments view the balance of costs and benefits .
This balance involves not only economic factors , but also such considerations as security and the desire to control one &apos;s own economic development .
The concept of &quot; twenty-first-century nationalization , &quot; introduced by Peruvian presidential candidate Ollanta Humala , mirrors in this respect the &quot; economic patriotism &quot; of French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin .
Reservations against FDI ( as against anything foreign ) can be found in all groups of countries , and politicians can bring them to the surface , resulting in protectionism .
It would be ironic , though , if developed countries -- which led the FDI liberalization wave of the past two decades -- now led a backlash against FDI .
Let us hope that the de-liberalization seen in developed countries can be checked before it spreads to other parts of the world and ultimately brings undesirable consequences for all .
Cultivating Energy
From climate change to volatile oil prices , all signs point to a looming global energy crisis .
Confronting the growing challenge means that humanity can no longer afford to ignore the inexhaustible resource found in the organic material that the sun provides each day through photosynthesis .
Solar energy enables plants to absorb carbon gas and thereby produce not only oxygen , but also matter that the animal kingdom uses for food -- and that our machines can use for energy .
Since the Neolithic ( or late Stone Age ) period , humans have been cultivating this &quot; biomass &quot; in order to feed itself .
Yet , even in today &apos;s world , its energy potential is ignored .
Beginning with the industrial revolution , humans sought energy from coal , and later from oil and natural gas , but this leads to the exhaustion of non-renewable resources .
Existing alternatives for diversifying energy production are limited .
Nuclear energy presents a number of disadvantages , owing to concerns about safety and disposal of radioactive waste .
Hydroelectric power is already widely used , while wind and solar energy are structurally sporadic and disparately available .
Biomass , on the other hand , has several advantages .
Supplies of it are large and available throughout the world .
Moreover , the technology necessary to convert it into energy -- including high-yield burning , gas conversion , and liquefaction into synthetic fuel -- has long been mastered .
Widely used during World War II , this technology has since advanced considerably .
Biomass energy , however , is the victim of unfair competition from fossil fuels .
Oil &apos;s price reflects its extraction , refining , and distribution costs , but not that of creating the raw material .
Millions of years and 200 tons of plant matter are necessary to produce one liter of oil , whereas just 15 kilograms of plant matter are required to make one liter of synthetic fuel .
After the oil glut , with oil below $ 20 a barrel , interest in developing energy from biomass ebbed , attractive only to &quot; green &quot; militants and those interested in fundamental science .
Yet the potential is immense .
The planet &apos;s biomass -- forests , pastureland , savannas , and crops -- make up productive capital that generates a 10 % &quot; return &quot; every year .
Like a battery that runs out and is then recharged by the sun , this supply is renewable indefinitely , as long as it is managed properly .
The annual return on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tons , yet only two billion tons is consumed for food purposes and 10 billion tons for energy .
Increasing the responsible use of this energy source would contribute to the fight against climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and diminishing the amount of fossil fuel required to produce energy .
Moreover , its abundance in southern countries promises to facilitate their economic development .
Considered the &quot; energy of the poor &quot; until today , biomass could become a source of wealth if it is grown and harnessed with the support of the international community .
Thus , &quot; energy crops &quot; could be developed to produce biofuel .
Residue from forest , agricultural , and agro-industrial activities could be collected and converted .
For example , the six million tons of waste produced annually by Niger could theoretically be used to meet that country &apos;s entire energy needs .
However , in many places , energy cropping would certainly compete with food crops .
Long-term estimates project that over a 50-year time horizon , most of the planet &apos;s arable land would have to be used to feed the world and for forest conservation .
Thus , areas dedicated to energy production , particularly biofuel , may not reach the level that societies would wish .
But , while such competition would reveal new global scarcities , it would also bring higher prices , thereby encouraging producers to increase yields and productivity .
Thus , while cultivating energy would create new constraints , it would also open new possibilities for many economic actors .
The farmer and the forest worker could become more involved in the market , the mine engineer could begin to take an interest in crop fields , the banker in plant shares , etc .
But , in order to prepare for a scaling up of energy cropping , new policies must be implemented , both in northern and southern countries , in terms of agriculture , land and water management , protection of biodiversity , fuel taxes , and information and awareness-raising .
The ancient Egyptians and the Incas practiced a religion of the Sun , believing it to be at the beginning of all life on Earth .
Science has since proven this to be the case .
Nowadays , when it has become more important than ever that we embrace renewable resources , we should use the Sun to cultivate our energy , just as our ancestors used it to cultivate their food .
The Culture of Entrepreneurship
Governments around the world want to promote entrepreneurship .
Though most business start-ups will never amount to much , each little company is an experiment , and a great deal of experimentation is necessary to produce the occasional firm that can transform a nation &apos;s economy -- or even rise to international significance .
In short , entrepreneurship is an incubator , and one that is essential to long-term economic success .
In explaining the variation in levels of entrepreneurship across countries , much attention is devoted nowadays to differences in national attitudes and policies .
But there are also significant differences in levels of entrepreneurship within individual countries .
People from Shanghai are said to be more entrepreneurial than people in Beijing .
People in the Ukrainian town of Kherson are more entrepreneurial than people from Kiev .
In a recent study , Mariassunta Giannetti and Andrei Simonov of the Stockholm School of Economics show the magnitude of differences in levels of entrepreneurship across Swedish municipalities .
They define entrepreneurs as people who report income from a company that they control and work in at least part-time , and find that the proportion of entrepreneurs in the population differs substantially across the 289 municipalities that they studied , ranging from 1.5 % to 18.5 % .
What can these differences tell us about the real causes of entrepreneurship ?
Policy changes at the national level cannot account for the variation Gianetti and Simonov found .
In the 1980 &apos;s and early 1990 &apos;s , centralized wage-setting agreements were dissolved and the Swedish government cut personal and corporate tax rates .
The level of entrepreneurial activity in the country as a whole doubled as a result , but the response was very different from one municipality to another .
Why ?
Cultural variables seem to explain a lot : religion and politics accounted for about half of the variation across municipalities .
Municipalities tended to have more entrepreneurs if they had a high proportion of pensioners who were members of the Church of Sweden ( the official state church until 2000 ) and a high proportion of right-wing voters .
Beyond that , a feedback mechanism appears to be in place : cities with more entrepreneurs tend to beget still more entrepreneurs .
Once an entrepreneurial culture takes root , it typically spreads locally , as people learn about business and begin to feel attracted by it -- even if it doesn &apos;t yield an immediate or certain payoff .
Indeed , Giannetti and Simonov discovered that the average income of entrepreneurs was lower in high-entrepreneurship municipalities than in the low-entrepreneurship ones .
Similarly , studies from other countries show that entrepreneurs often have lower initial earnings and earnings growth than they would have as employees .
What these studies suggest is that differences in the degree of entrepreneurship may be due less to better economic opportunities ( the &quot; supply &quot; side of the entrepreneurship equation ) than to cultural differences that make entrepreneurship personally more rewarding ( the &quot; demand &quot; side ) .
This hypothesis is supported by Giannetti and Simonov , who argue that differences in the prestige of entrepreneurs across municipalities may account for differences in levels of entrepreneurship .
In some municipalities , entrepreneurs enjoy high social status , regardless of whether they are already successful ; elsewhere they are looked down upon and other occupations are more admired .
The idea that prestige is important is not new .
In her book Money , Morals &amp; Manners , the sociologist Michèle Lamont compared definitions of success in France and the United States .
She interviewed people in both countries and asked them what it meant to be a &quot; worthy person . &quot;
In essence , she was asking people about their sense of what is important in life and about their own personal sense of identity .
Lamont &apos;s study confirmed the conventional wisdom that Americans value business success , while the French place greater value on culture and quality of life .
Likewise , open contempt of &quot; money-hungry &quot; businesspeople and competition is expressed more often in France than in America .
But , while Lamont focused on differences between the French and the Americans , her study &apos;s most interesting finding was that of significant differences between regions within France .
She compared Clermont-Ferrand , the capital of Auvergne , in the center of France , with Paris .
Auvergne &apos;s inhabitants have a reputation for being parsimonious and stern , and , despite substantial recent progress , for a relative dearth of high culture .
Lamont found that people in both Paris and Clermont-Ferrand tended to express contempt for &quot; money-grubbing . &quot;
But the Clermontois valued &quot; simplicity , pragmatism , hard work , and resolve , &quot; while the Parisians put more stress on &quot; pizzazz and brilliance . &quot;
She concluded that , &quot; In many respects the Clermontois are closer to the Hoosiers ( as the residents of the US mid-Western state of Indiana are called ) than to the Parisians . &quot;
Her evidence suggests that in Clermont-Ferrand , as compared to Paris , there is a higher intrinsic demand for starting small businesses .
Virtually every country is a pastiche of local cultures that differ in how they motivate people and shape their personal identity .
Differences in how these cultures define what it means to be a worthy person , and how worthiness is signaled , probably explain much of the variation in levels of entrepreneurship .
Economists and others often tend to look at countries as a whole and emphasize national attitudes and national policies as the main factors in encouraging or discouraging entrepreneurship .
But , in fact , the national success in entrepreneurship depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with national policies .
Entrepreneurship can take root in culturally congenial regions of any country after economic barriers against it are lifted , and then feed on itself to grow to national significance .
Ivy League Investors
Yale University , where I teach , has entrusted its endowment portfolio to one man , David Swensen , for over 20 years .
During this period , the portfolio has grown from just over $ 1 billion to $ 18 billion -- an average return of more than 16 % a year , which appears to be the highest of any major university .
And it shows no signs of diminishing : in the latest fiscal year ending in June , the return was 22.9 % .
Presidents of Yale have come and gone , but Swensen stays on .
He has done more for the university than any president , or anyone else .
In a university , ideas count more than money , but $ 18 billion dollars can create an environment for many new ideas .
With 11,500 students , that is more than $ 1.5 million per student ( not including the university &apos;s buildings and art collection , each worth many billions of dollars more ) .
How did this happen ?
How did Swensen make so much money ?
Everyone is wondering -- not least those of us at Yale .
After all , many people here have been teaching the &quot; efficient markets hypothesis &quot; that financial markets around the world have become so competitive that it is impossible to make more than a normal return from investing .
Anyone who beats the market must simply be lucky .
Studies seem to confirm this .
For example , a 2004 study by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the University of California and Yi-Tsung Lee and Yiu-Jane Liu at National Chengchi University acquired trade-by-trade data on individual day traders on the Taiwan Stock Exchange .
The study found that only the top 1 % of day traders made a profit -- after deducting trading costs -- in two consecutive six-month periods , and the median profit was hardly worth the effort : only about US $ 4000 .
It is easy to conclude that there is just no point in even trying to beat the market .
But then one remembers people like Swensen .
Can his consistent performance really be attributed to luck ?
Robert Kiyosaki , author of the Rich Dad , Poor Dad series of popular investment books , bases his books &apos; titles and themes on a comparison of his own highly-educated father with his friend &apos;s father , an eighth-grade dropout .
According to Kiyosaki , his poor but scholarly dad tended to be pessimistic about one &apos;s ability to achieve anything in the real world , so he discouraged his son from even trying .
By contrast , the friend &apos;s dad relished trying to achieve something big .
Is it just a coincidence that he was rich ?
Kiyosaki may try too hard to be inspirational , but I often think of him when I hear finance professors opine on the efficiency of markets and the futility of making money by trading in them .
Maybe many academics find it difficult to take the initiative to achieve in the real world -- I have yet to meet another professor who has mentioned having read Kiyosaki .
But Swensen is an academic , with a Ph.D. in economics .
He is surrounded by academics .
Somehow , all this talk about efficient markets has not discouraged him from trying , and succeeding .
There seems to be a pattern .
Two similar universities , Harvard and Princeton , have had nearly the same success .
The Harvard endowment , under Jack Meyer , earned a 15.2 % average annual return over the last ten years , compared to Swensen &apos;s 17.2 % average , while the Princeton endowment , under Andrew Golden , earned an average of 15.6 % per year .
In fact , Golden worked under Swensen at Yale from 1988 until 1993 .
Swensen has written two books about investing , one for professionals and one for the general public .
I did not come away from reading them with a feeling that I know how to do what he did .
But a couple of things stand out .
One is his long-term focus .
Yale lets Swensen invest for the very long term , and does not bother him about quarterly performance .
Maybe this allows him to focus more on long-term fundamentals -- and thus to make investments that may not perform well in the short run .
But , in fact , he has done consistently well in both the short term and the long term .
Part of the reason for Swensen &apos;s success is &quot; absolute return , &quot; a term -- now widely quoted in the investment community -- that he coined for unusual investment strategies involving such things as merger arbitrage and distressed securities .
He also has invested in non-traditional asset classes , including real estate , oil , timber , private equity , and venture capital and buyout firms .
These assets are generally not followed by multiple analysts , and are not easily understood , giving him a greater advantage in applying his intellectual skills and the skills of others around him .
In these senses , Swensen is completely different from day traders , who are both investing for the short term and trying to beat the most crowded market -- the market for exchange-listed securities .
But I also think that the phenomenal success of Swensen and others like him reflects the environment that Kiyosaki criticizes .
The problem is a defeatist attitude , not scholarship .
When an analytical mind , a mind that is trained to search rigorously for the truth and as part of a community of such people is set free from self-doubt , it can do amazing things .
Knowing David Swensen , I can attest that he is not a lonely day trader trying to beat the market .
He is a good listener , is supportive of people he trusts , and is surrounded by a lot of good people with a wide array of skills .
And he is certainly not a defeatist .
The Ethics of Eating
Global meat consumption is predicted to double by 2020 .
Yet in Europe and North America , there is growing concern about the ethics of the way meat and eggs are produced .
The consumption of veal has fallen sharply since it became widely known that to produce so-called &quot; white &quot; -- actually pale pink -- veal , newborn calves are separated from their mothers , deliberately made anemic , denied roughage , and kept in stalls so narrow that they cannot walk or turn around .
In Europe , mad cow disease shocked many people , not only because it shattered beef &apos;s image as a safe and healthy food , but also because they learned that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep .
People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal , chicken litter ( complete with chicken droppings ) , and slaughterhouse waste .
Concern about how we treat farm animals is far from being limited to the small percentage of people who are vegetarians or even vegans -- eating no animal products at all .
Despite strong ethical arguments for vegetarianism , it is not yet a mainstream position .
More common is the view that we are justified in eating meat , as long as the animals have a decent life before they are killed .
The problem , as Jim Mason and I describe in our recent book , The Way We Eat , is that industrial agriculture denies animals even a minimally decent life .
Tens of billions of chickens produced today never go outdoors .
They are bred to have voracious appetites and gain weight as fast as possible , then reared in sheds that can hold more than 20,000 birds .
The level of ammonia in the air from their accumulated droppings stings the eye and hurts the lungs .
Slaughtered at only 45 days old , their immature bones can hardly bear the weight of their bodies .
Some collapse and , unable to reach food or water , soon die , their fate irrelevant to the economics of the enterprise as a whole .
Conditions are , if anything , even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if there were just one per cage , she would be unable to stretch her wings .
But there are usually at least four hens per cage , and often more .
Under such crowded conditions , the more dominant , aggressive birds are likely to peck to death the weaker hens in the cage .
To prevent this , producers sear off all birds &apos; beaks with a hot blade .
A hen &apos;s beak is full of nerve tissue -- it is , after all , her principal means of relating to her environment -- but no anesthetic or analgesic is used to relieve the pain .
Pigs may be the most intelligent and sensitive of the animals that we commonly eat .
When foraging in a rural village , they can exercise that intelligence and explore their varied environment .
Before they give birth , sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a comfortable and safe nest in which to nurse their litter .
But in today &apos;s factory farms , pregnant sows are kept in crates so narrow that they cannot turn around , or even walk more than a step forward or backward .
They lie on bare concrete without straw or any other form of bedding .
The piglets are taken from the sow as soon as possible , so that she can be made pregnant again , but they never leave the shed until they are taken to slaughter .
Defenders of these production methods argue that they are a regrettable but necessary response to a growing population &apos;s demand for food .
On the contrary , when we confine animals in factory farms , we have to grow food for them .
The animals burn up most of that food &apos;s energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm , so we end up with a small fraction -- usually no more than one-third and sometimes as little as one-tenth -- of the food value that we feed them .
By contrast , cows grazing on pasture eat food that we cannot digest , which means that they add to the amount of food available to us .
It is tragic that countries like China and India , as they become more prosperous , are copying Western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to supply more meat and eggs for their growing middle classes .
If this continues , the result will be animal suffering on an even greater scale than now exists in the West , as well as more environmental damage and a rise in heart disease and cancers of the digestive system .
It will also be grossly inefficient .
As consumers , we have the power -- and the moral obligation -- to refuse to support farming methods that are cruel to animals and bad for us .
Fear and Freedom on the Internet
Earlier this month it was reported that , at the request of China &apos;s rulers , Microsoft shut down the Web site of a Chinese blogger that was maintained on a Microsoft service called MSN Spaces .
The blogger , Zhao Jing , had been reporting on a strike by journalists at The Beijing News that followed the dismissal of the newspaper &apos;s independent-minded editor .
Microsoft &apos;s action raises a key question : can the Internet really be a force for freedom that repressive governments cannot control as easily as newspapers , radio , and television ?
Ironically , Microsoft &apos;s founder and chairman , Bill Gates , has been an enthusiastic advocate of this view .
Just last October , he said : &quot; There &apos;s really no way to , in a broad sense , repress information today , and I think that &apos;s a wonderful advance we can all feel good about … . &#91; T &#93; his is a medium of total openness and total freedom , and that &apos;s what makes it so special . &quot;
Despite these sentiments , Microsoft is helping the Chinese authorities to repress information as best they can .
A Microsoft spokeswoman was reported as saying that the corporation has blocked &quot; many sites &quot; in China , and it has been known for several months that Microsoft &apos;s blog tool in China filters words like &quot; democracy &quot; and &quot; human rights &quot; from blog titles .
Microsoft &apos;s defense is that it must &quot; comply with local and global laws . &quot;
But the MSN Spaces sites are maintained on servers in the United States .
The relevant local laws would therefore seem to be those of the US , and Zhao Jing &apos;s discussion of the Beijing journalists &apos; strike does not violate any of them .
Nor are there any global laws that prevent Chinese people from discussing events that their government would prefer them not to discuss .
The New York Times , for example , is free to publish its report on the strike , even though it operates a Web site that anyone with unfettered Internet access can read .
If the Chinese government does not want its citizens to read a foreign newspaper , then it is up to them to figure out how to block access to it .
The newspaper is under no obligation to do it for them .
So Microsoft &apos;s defense misfires .
We can only guess at the company &apos;s real reason for taking down the Web site , but fear of repercussions against its commercial interests in China seems likely to have been an important factor .
To be sure , a corporation can and should place limits on the use of its services .
The absolutist line -- let complete freedom of expression prevail -- crumbles in the face of uncomfortable examples .
According to Gates , Microsoft might prevent the use of its services to spread instructions about making nuclear bombs , to send pro-Nazi statements into Germany , where such material is illegal , and to propagate child pornography .
But how relevant are such examples ?
In his classic defense of freedom of expression , On Liberty , John Stuart Mill argued that the most important reason for freedom of expression is to promote competition between the widest possible range of ideas , and that unfettered debate is the best way to test them .
For the government to protect ideas from criticism is to turn them into a lifeless and rigid dogma , regardless of whether they are true .
If we agree with Mill , then only one of Gates &apos;s examples falls into the category of expression that should be protected .
Recipes for making nuclear bombs are techniques , not ideas .
Nor is child pornography the expression of ideas .
We may therefore restrict both of them without running afoul of Mill &apos;s argument .
( On the other hand , an essay arguing that there is nothing wrong with adults taking a sexual interest in children , and that such conduct should be permitted , expresses ideas , and thus should not be censored , no matter how poisonous we may consider them . )
The most difficult of Gates &apos;s three examples is that of pro-Nazi statements on a Web site aimed at Germany .
It is easy to understand why Germany would wish to prohibit such statements .
Several countries &apos; laws proscribe incitement of racial hatred , which can be justified , consistently with Mill &apos;s defense of liberty , if such laws really focus narrowly on incitement of hatred rather than on suppressing arguments , bad as they may be , that appeal to people &apos;s intellectual capacities .
A defender of suppression of Nazi ideas might argue that have already been tried , and have failed -- in the most horrendous manner imaginable -- to produce a better society .
Nevertheless , the best possible sign that Germany has overcome its Nazi past would be to focus its laws specifically on incitement to racial hatred , rather than on Nazism as such .
In any case , China &apos;s crackdown on straightforward reporting and discussion of events taking place in that country is not the suppression of a discredited political ideology , but of open and informed political debate .
If Bill Gates really believes that the Internet should be a liberating force , he should ensure that Microsoft does not do the dirty work of China &apos;s government .
The Weakness of the Strong Dollar
It is always risky to write about exchange rates .
If a currency &apos;s exchange rate is falling , it may well be rising by the time one &apos;s article appears .
But the issue of how we should think about exchange rates and their appropriate management is a perennial one .
So what is at issue now is not just the falling dollar , but rather what US officials intend to do about it .
Paul O &apos;Neill , the outspoken US Treasury Secretary , suggests that there is little the US could or would do to sustain the dollar .
His remarks were criticized by some as abandoning the strong dollar policy that was the Clinton Administration &apos;s hallmark .
One responsibility of economic leadership is to dispel economic myths--certainly not to create them .
The &quot; strong dollar &quot; policy represents an especially egregious example of an economic myth ; it seems to suggest that the US Treasury could , and would , maintain the strong dollar , and that a strong dollar is good for the US .
When I was chairman of the President &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers , I was often asked if I supported the strong dollar policy .
I replied that I believed in an &quot; equilibrium dollar . &quot;
In other words , exchange rates are no different from other prices .
Like the price of apples and oranges , market forces should determine them .
Anyone who says he believes in a &quot; strong orange policy &quot; would be ridiculed .
Yet some of those who seem to have the greatest faith in market forces treat exchange rates as if they were governed by laws other than those of standard economics , so that a word or even a look from a finance minister could lead currencies to soar or plummet .
Of course , there is considerable irrationality in currency markets .
Keynes once described asset markets as beauty contests , in which the objective is not to ascertain who is the most beautiful person , but whom others will think is the most beautiful .
The objective in currency markets is , indeed , often to guess what others will be thinking .
But even if government intervention can affect exchange rates in the short run , in the longer run , it is market fundamentals that matter .
There may be a legitimate role for government in limiting excessive volatility , but if underlying economic fundamentals do not drive the exchange rate , what is the basis of our confidence in the market system ?
Belief in misguided notions inevitably leads to further nonsense .
On one occasion , a reporter queried the US Treasury on the adverse effects of the strong dollar on exports ( at the time , car sales and other exports were suffering . )
The response was that the strong dollar meant a strong economy , and a strong economy strengthens the ability to export .
But of course , even the US Treasury , as powerful as it may be , cannot repeal the laws of economics .
Demand curves are downward sloping : typically , at higher prices , others will demand less of Americana goods , and a strong dollar means that American goods are more expensive .
Perhaps the most important objection to the strong dollar policy is that it encourages precisely this confusion between a strong dollar and a strong economy .
We should no more be emotionally attached to the exchange rate than to any other price .
A stronger exchange rate discourages exports , and when an economy is facing rising unemployment , it can make a bad situation worse .
On the other hand , a higher exchange rate may also lead to lower inflation , as import prices fall .
When inflation is the primary concern , a strong exchange rate may be good for the economy .
The strong dollar policy reeks of an economic nationalism that is out of step with the era of globalization .
If the dollar is strong , then the euro or the yen is weak .
But how are political and economic leaders in other countries to respond ?
Should they simply agree to the strong dollar policy , even though it implies a weak yen or euro policy ?
What is required is a debate with the US , for the strong dollar has led to an anomalous situation : the world &apos;s richest country seems unable to live within its means and must continually borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from abroad to finance its huge trade deficits .
The strong dollar--far more than Japanese protectionism--fuelled the bilateral deficit with Japan .
It also contributed to protectionism at home , reflected in the new US steel tariffs .
It is high time that the nonsense of the strong dollar policy be laid to rest .
Paul O &apos;Neill should be commended for helping in this effort .
Perhaps we can now begin to think more seriously about creating an international economic system that acknowledges the devastating effects that market volatility among major currencies has on less developed countries , and that ensures greater stability .
For too long , we have blamed the victims .
That has merely permitted us to avoid taking a hard look at the system itself .
Is China Cheating ?
Foul play !
How else , says the US , could China undercut American producers in so many areas ?
For decades America seemed to dominate manufacturing , so US officials focused on liberalizing trade in manufactured goods .
They put little effort into creating a level playing field for farmers , since they knew America couldn &apos;t compete in agriculture .
Now , China is out-competing everyone , racking up huge trade surpluses with the US .
So America &apos;s Treasury Secretary accuses China of deliberately keepings its exchange rate low , and calls for China to let market forces determine the value of the reminbi .
The IMF &apos;s departing Chief Economist , Ken Rogoff , warns that the surpluses put global stability at risk .
For those who recall East Asia &apos;s crisis of five years ago , much of this seems to run counter to what was said then .
China was urged not to float its currency .
Until Argentina &apos;s peso imploded , fixed exchange rates were fine .
The US Treasury welcomed government intervention in exchange rate markets , and encouraged the IMF to support such interventions with mega-billion dollar loans to crisis countries .
If China had let its currency float back then , it would have depreciated in value , deepening the crisis .
Countries were warned : avoid trade deficits and build up reserves , because they are the key frontline defense .
East Asia &apos;s countries followed that advice , and for a good reason : they had seen the consequences of a lack of reserves .
East Asia &apos;s governments knew then that the IMF &apos;s policies would deepen their downturns , but they were helpless to resist .
The IMF had the money they needed .
China and Malaysia , lucky enough not to have to turn to the IMF or brave enough to set their own course , did what every textbook said you should do : they pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies .
China &apos;s economy continued to grow at 7 % ; Malaysia had the shortest and shallowest downturn .
To understand what is at stake , a few basic economic points need to be spelled out .
First , international trade is based on the principle of comparative advantage ; countries export goods in which they have a relative advantage and import goods in which they have a relative disadvantage .
By and large , America now has a relative disadvantage in manufacturing , while China has a relative advantage .
China should be exporting manufactured goods to the US .
Secondly , if a country invests more than it saves , it will need to borrow , and the counterpart to that borrowing is a trade deficit .
America &apos;s burgeoning trade deficit is a result of the Bush Administration &apos;s unprecedented mismanagement .
Tax cuts that America could ill afford turned a huge fiscal surplus into a massive deficit ; rather than saving , America &apos;s government is borrowing , much of it from abroad .
That , not China &apos;s exchange rate policy , is the culprit .
In fact , China &apos;s overall trade surplus today is actually small , around 1 % of its GDP .
Of course , the Bush Administration wants to shift the blame , but neither China , nor anyone else , should be fooled .
This is reminiscent of what happened twenty years ago , when President Reagan engineered huge tax cuts that were supposed to pay for themselves , but which incited huge fiscal deficits , which in turn led to huge trade deficits .
Back then , Japan was blamed !
The harsh truth is that neither the IMF nor the Bush administration really believes in free markets .
They interfere with markets when it suits their purposes .
The Bush Administration supported bailouts for airlines , unprecedented subsidies for agriculture , and tariff protections for steel .
The IMF is right : there is a real risk of global instability , but the underlying cause is massive US borrowing from abroad , which began under President Reagan .
This turned the US into a huge debtor .
If , someday , America &apos;s creditors decide that they want to hold fewer dollars , it could set off large exchange rate movements , causing global instability .
Why hasn &apos;t the IMF sternly criticized these deficits ?
Why should the richest country in the world live beyond its means while the IMF scolds poorer countries for smaller transgressions ?
This problem is compounded by the global reserve system , which sees most countries demanding US dollars , effectively to bury them in the ground .
The system requires the reserve currency country ( the US ) to be a massive debtor--to the point where others lose faith .
But to solve deep-seated problems with the global financial system , we need to go beyond the complacency that has long marked the G-7 and the unilateralism that defines the current US administration .
China is right to have ignored America &apos;s demands .
Floating the exchange rate would expose the country to instabilities that would lead to a host of further problems , particularly the country &apos;s shaky banking system .
A higher exchange rate would undermine job creation and would contribute to deflation , which China is successfully combating .
China is fortunate to have the freedom to follow its own views .
Its huge foreign currency reserves give it the freedom to ignore the IMF and the US Treasury .
In the end , this may be the most compelling reason for why China should continue to run trade surpluses .
Once again , China has shown its mastery of basic economic principles .
Others in the region only wish that they could have acted similarly .
Can Italy Survive Berlusconi ?
If history seems likely to rank Silvio Berlusconi as an inconsequential Prime Minister of Italy , it will surely remember him as an extraordinary -- and extraordinarily bizarre -- one .
Promising one thing and delivering another was not so much a weakness of his government as its organizing principle .
Given the erratic nature of Berlusconi &apos;s rule , it is no surprise that , ever since the 2001 election that returned him to power , the center-left l &apos;Unione coalition has won all subsequent elections -- administrative , regional , and European .
Yet the left &apos;s prospects in the upcoming parliamentary election are far from certain , and Berlusconi seems far from doomed .
Given the country &apos;s economic conditions , one would think that Italy is ripe for decisive change .
For the last four years , average growth in incomes has been a mere 0.3 % , compared to 1.5 % in the European Union , and in the past two years public debt has again started to rise .
Moreover , the strategy of Berlusconi &apos;s ruling center-right Casa della Libertà coalition has been to tread water and wait for Europe &apos;s economy to pick up instead of tackling Italy &apos;s structural difficulties .
As a result , the government is criticized not only by the unions , but also by the employers &apos; association , Confindustria , which in 2001 gave Prime Minister Berlusconi strong support .
Then there is the ongoing conflict of interests between Berlusconi-the-Premier and Berlusconi-the-magnate , who holds public licenses that make him a semi-monopolist in media and TV advertising .
During Berlusconi &apos;s tenure in office , his enormous personal assets have tripled .
While his parliamentary majority has approved many laws that promote his personal interests and have eased some of his legal difficulties , at the beginning of March , Berlusconi was again accused of corruption and tax fraud .
Berlusconi &apos;s ministers have scarcely behaved better .
Two were forced to resign within a month of each other .
Roberto Calderoli , a prominent official in Lega Nord , the third-largest government party , provoked riots in Libya by wearing a t-shirt printed with the infamous cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad .
Francesco Storace , the former Minister of Health and a leading member of Alleanza Nazionale , the second-largest government party , is suspected of organizing political espionage , in an Italian-style Watergate .
But , despite the government &apos;s catastrophic economic and ethical record , opinion polls indicate a lead of only about four percentage points for l &apos;Unione — too small , given the high number of undecided voters , to predict the election &apos;s outcome .
So what is keeping Berlusconi and his coalition in the race ?
Above all , Berlusconi &apos;s electoral campaign is aimed , in the manner of President Bush &apos;s 2004 re-election campaign , at energizing his hard-core supporters and mobilizing the growing number of voters who have abstained in recent years .
In doing this he has not hesitated to use his semi-monopoly over television to exalt his government &apos;s alleged accomplishments .
His campaign rhetoric highlights anti-communism with an emphasis not seen in Italy since 1948 , coupled with a defense of the family and values cherished by the Roman Catholic establishment , although the Church has so far resisted being drawn into the campaign .
The Berlusconi coalition also benefits from the weakness of l &apos;Unione .
Its leader , Romano Prodi , obtained an extraordinary popular endorsement when more than four million people voted for him in Italy &apos;s first-ever primary elections .
Yet Prodi continues to be a party-less leader of too many parties .
To be sure , the cohesiveness of l &apos;Unione has strengthened : the two major parties ( Democratici di Sinistra and Democrazia e Libertà - la Margherita ) are united under the symbol of the olive tree , the other parties have endorsed a detailed 280-page government program , and the left-wing Partito della Rifondazione Comunista has given clear signs of moderation and loyalty to the coalition .
For voters , however , a perception of fragility remains .
Finally , the uncertainty of the outcome reflects not so much voters &apos; behavior , but a change in the electoral system .
During the past decade , Italy has used a majority electoral system corrected by a proportional quota .
Under this system , Casa della Libertà translated a small popular majority in 2001 into a decisive parliamentary majority .
But , with the same result on the horizon this year for l &apos;Unione , the center-right parliamentary majority changed the electoral law just a few months before the end of its term .
This is reminiscent of an army that , fearing defeat on the battlefield , poisons the wells as it retreats .
A proportional system in the absence of individual preferences means that party secretaries , rather than citizens , will choose deputies , and , with no effective electoral threshold , the number of parties will proliferate .
Although the election ballot will be 40 centimeters long to accommodate all the symbols of the old and new parties , it won &apos;t contain the name of even a single candidate .
But the worst problem is that the majority system for the Senate could lead to a different majority gaining control there than in the Chamber of Deputies ( the lower house ) , which may well cause legislative paralysis .
Moreover , President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi &apos;s mandate ends at the same time that parliament dissolves , which means that his successor , elected by the new parliament , would have to nominate a government without a majority in both houses .
Berlusconi and Prodi have ruled out a German-style grand coalition -- an outcome that seems especially unlikely following an election campaign in which both contestants have strongly hinted that their opponent has no legitimate right to govern .
At the same time , holding another vote would leave the question of the electoral law unresolved .
The puzzle of Berlusconi &apos;s survival reflects a wider European conundrum .
Many Europeans , not just Italians , are nervous and unsure of where the continent is going .
So it is no surprise that an opportunist and charlatan like Berlusconi continues to get a hearing .
Italians must decide upon the sort of Italy they want if they are to get leaders of the stature they need .
The Transatlantic Blame Game
As if the diplomatic spat over Iraq weren &apos;t bad enough , relations between America and Europe are being slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies .
Indeed , the differences between the two sides &apos; economic strategies are as sharp as they have been in two decades .
At first glance , the depth of this &quot; policy gap &quot; seems surprising .
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and for 2004 has improved recently both in the US and Europe .
Moreover , the US and Europe face a similar challenge : encouraging economic recovery .
But their governments &apos; actions--or lack of action--make it seem as if neither side can see the problems faced by the other .
When the Euro was introduced , most EU members--Germany , in particular--looked forward to managing their economic policies with more autonomy and less US pressure .
Thus , today &apos;s framework in Euro area , with its unique mix of joint monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy , was not constructed to facilitate macroeconomic coordination with the US .
But the perception of many American observers was different .
They saw the central implication of the Euro as requiring Europe to junk its supposed role as a &quot; free rider &quot; in the international economy , one that left the US shouldering the burden of policy adjustments to promote global growth .
Europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate its policies with America .
These two views were bound to conflict , and now they do .
Tensions hidden during the long Clinton-era boom rose throughout 2001 , when America tried to address its economic downturn by rapidly easing its monetary and fiscal policies .
As big budget deficits returned , so did European skepticism about the sustainability of America &apos;s mounting external deficit and the overvalued dollar .
American critics , meanwhile , saw the Euro area as overly cautious for cutting interest rates slowly and maintaining the fiscal constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact .
Initially , the Europeans underestimated the slowdown they confronted .
Subsequently , they were constrained by the limits to their fiscal reactions embodied in the Maastricht Treaty ; the large economies of Continental Europe had not done enough budgetary consolidation during the years of good growth .
Both monetary and fiscal policies facilitated growth , but Europe did not help much to redress America &apos;s external imbalance .
Of course , the Euro area is so large a player that it can no longer leave responsibility for stimulating global growth to America .
But US efforts to encourage Europeans to adopt their pragmatic and discretionary approach to economic policy inevitably lead to frustration : the issues confronting the European economies are different from those facing the US--as are perceptions about the challenges .
In fact , the main reasons for the massive swing in US public finances--from surplus in 2000 to a deficit of more than 4 % in 2003-04--have little to do with stabilization .
Aside from the costs of the Iraq war and other security concerns , along with lapses in earlier spending controls , US tax cuts have structural and distributional rather than short-term aims .
A short-term stimulus would not have bestowed the largest benefits upon the most affluent , whose spending is less sensitive to taxes .
The cuts should sustain private demand this year and next , but at the cost of postponing improvements in private saving and indebtedness .
Although the dollar has been depreciating for a year , continuing growth in domestic demand will likely push the current account deficit above 5 % of GDP .
As the deficit widens further , dollar depreciation will likely resume , despite laggardly performances by the world &apos;s other major economies .
Will the US accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004 , and could Europe make a greater contribution to global growth ?
Probably not .
The counterpart to the US emphasis on self-reliance rather than direct public assistance is that employment must be maintained at high levels--regardless of the party in power--whereas most European countries have been prepared to accept unemployment rates of 8 % or more .
So the US is likely to opt for growth .
Despite three years of weak growth , the gap between potential and actual output in Continental Europe &apos;s largest economies is currently smaller than in the US .
Income tax cuts to stimulate demand for labor and investment are desirable , given high rates in Europe &apos;s largest economies .
But tax cuts that must soon be reversed--due mainly to demographic pressure on public pensions and healthcare--are unlikely to stimulate demand as consumers lose confidence in government &apos;s ability to control deficits .
Europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management , not inflation .
The EU countries are finally accelerating their implementation of structural reforms , but the starting point has become less favorable and political resistance too entrenched , as illustrated by the recent conflicts over reforms of French pensions and the German labor market .
Further dollar depreciation as well as slower US growth will undermine EU exports , the one relatively successful component of demand in Europe .
The divergence in policy and its time horizon will be papered over by the improved outlook for growth in both Europe and the US for the next year or so .
But the medium-term outlook is one of transatlantic confrontation , potentially as divisive as the disputes over the Iraq war .
If so , the ongoing Doha Round of international trade negotiations could be first to suffer .
Protectionism will be harder to resist on both sides of the Atlantic .
The US cannot afford a continuing massive drain of demand through an external deficit , while complaints about loss of competitiveness will intensify in the EU .
It strains the imagination to think that the coming macroeconomic confrontation could subside quickly or quietly .
Multilateral Engagement for Energy Security
Our global need for energy reliability binds us together as surely as the global network that delivers it ; a failure in one part of our network will inevitably affect everyone .
Local interests and persistent conflicts that sit astride our networks , including the as yet unresolved issue of Russian gas supply to Ukraine and Europe , have again raised the specter of energy being used as a weapon to gain political leverage .
Energy security is at the top of the agenda of the G-8 meeting hosted by President Vladimir Putin in Saint Petersburg .
The G-8 has correctly identified the key economic issue , energy interdependence , and now is the time for focused multilateral engagement on this issue .
For some countries that are blessed with vast supplies of oil and gas , the use of energy exports to reward friends and punish foes seems a tempting option .
Today , however , it is more likely to prove disruptive to friend and foe alike , as well as damaging to those countries that indulge this temptation .
Energy embargoes have generally proven counterproductive .
The price rises that followed OPEC &apos;s oil embargoes of the 1970 &apos;s were unsustainable and led to conservation efforts and expansion of non-OPEC production .
As a result , OPEC &apos;s share of world oil exports dropped sharply in the twelve years following the embargo of 1973-1974 .
Experience has taught us that transparency and price stability is in everyone &apos;s interest .
Pursuit of these principals while encouraging the development of global markets is essential to greater overall growth prospects for the world economy .
So when Russia sought earlier this year to quadruple the price of its gas exports to Ukraine , it argued that it was simply demanding market rates .
The message sounded fair and it did , for a short time , appeal to some policymakers and investors not fully apprised of the situation .
To be clear , measured price changes implemented over time was never in dispute ; indeed , some internal price adjustments for Ukraine were in order .
Unfortunately for Russia &apos;s neighbors , it is not the market that determines what price is paid for Russia &apos;s gas or transport ; it is Gazprom and its chairman , Dmitry Medvedev , who is also the Russian government &apos;s First Deputy Prime Minister .
The price charged by Gazprom for each country bordering Russia is different and is largely determined by political relationships with the Kremlin .
Economically speaking , gas supply and transport prices are more correlated to political relationships than to fundamental supply-demand or gas transport basis calculations .
Ukraine was threatened with an immediate quadrupling of its prices -- or interruption of its gas supply - as a result of it new-found independence from Russia during the Orange Revolution .
Georgia , also feeling the wrath of Moscow following the Rose Revolution , faced potentially harmful price increases as well .
Belarus , however , still in strong alignment with the Kremlin , continues to enjoy highly subsidized gas .
Of course , Ukraine was not the only country put at risk by this brinksmanship ; suppliers such as Turkmenistan , geographically locked into transit requirements through Russia , also suffer .
And for the consuming nations of Western and Central Europe , the price effects and supply disruption anxieties were of significant consequence .
Immediate multilateral intervention by the European Union and the United States probably are what probably caused Gazprom to turn the gas back on .
Natural gas may be the commodity most vulnerable to event-driven supply disruptions .
The fixed interconnected pipelines lock producers and consumers in a near-exclusive embrace .
Diversification in natural gas transportations is a long-term cross-border asset development proposition requiring enormous investment and political commitment on a multilateral level .
Many solutions are already under consideration : new gas storage capacity , increased efficiency , expansion of domestic production of both oil and gas , and alternative energy supplies such as coal-bed methane .
Additionally , a market in tradable liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) is rapidly emerging .
It is more feasible to diversify the supply chain , albeit incrementally , by importing gas from distant producers rather than from monopolistic suppliers next door .
All of these efforts together will soften shocks somewhat and create more energy self-sufficiency .
Yet more is required .
First , G-8 leaders should consider implementing standards in energy transactions requiring open and transparent contracts in line with best practices in business .
It is important to dilute the global impact of local politicians pursuing non ‑ energy agendas , or simply their own limited interests .
We see these problems today in state-owned firms in Latin America , political unrest in Africa , tensions in the Middle East or through opaque business intermediaries , as in the questionable gas deal between Ukraine and Russia , known now as RUE ( RosUkrEnergo ) .
In the end , energy security for all of us in Europe requires recognizing that the linked nature of our supply and transmission systems makes us interdependent .
This is where an &quot; Energy Alliance &quot; of consumers and suppliers could be useful , starting with the nations of Europe helping to guarantee the energy supplies of others in a major disruption .
The Energy Charter , which emphasizes market access and transparency , is a laudable effort but it is not sufficient for those moments of crisis ; our markets are not yet well enough equipped to deal with event-driven disruptions .
The Energy Charter might be a vehicle for this collective energy security , if deepened and broadened .
It is our duty as leaders to chart a course for a secure energy future .
Tolerance of questionable dealing today for the sake of political expediency will cost more in the future for us all .
When the inevitable conflict occurs , public confidence , political credibility and market reliability are needlessly sacrificed -- this has clearly occurred for Russia and for Ukraine .
Threats to energy security must be challenged and resolved on a multilateral basis , with all stakeholders present .
The interdependent nature of our energy infrastructure requires a multilateral approach .
We are all depending on it .
Reform or Revolution in Iran ?
The Lebanon Proxy
Over the past few weeks , Lebanese politicians from groups as diverse as Hezbollah and the Christian Lebanese Forces have been meeting intermittently in what has been dubbed a &quot; National Dialogue . &quot;
Their primary objective is to forge a consensus for Lebanon &apos;s future in the wake of the withdrawal of Syrian forces last year .
But what their dialogue has exposed is how much Lebanese politics continues to be shaped by external forces .
The Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad retains huge influence over key levers of the Lebanese state , including the security and intelligence apparatus , the army , and the judiciary -- not to mention an alliance with the militarily powerful Hezbollah .
Though Syrian soldiers may have withdrawn a year ago , Assad &apos;s regime never got over its departure from Lebanon , and it seeks to re-impose some form of hegemony over the country .
Syria &apos;s stance is complicated by an ongoing United Nations investigation that accuses it of involvement in the February 14 , 2005 , assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri .
While Syria &apos;s Lebanese allies have called for improved ties between the two countries , the Hariri murder makes this doubtful .
For the moment , the Lebanese parties have agreed not to allow their territory to be used as a base for any presumed threats to the Syrian regime .
At the same time , Egypt and Saudi Arabia want desperately to avoid the downfall of Assad &apos;s regime .
Publicly , they support the UN &apos;s investigation , but privately they have encouraged , even pressured , the Lebanese government to lower the heat on Syria .
Lebanese adversaries of Syria have resisted such demands , but the Egyptian and Saudi stance highlights how , for reasons of self-interest , Arab regimes rarely like to see fellow despots fall .
Indeed , the Egyptian and Saudi attitude contrasts starkly with that of two Western powers with extensive influence in Lebanon , the United States and France , which support the UN inquiry wherever it might go .
Nevertheless , all four states agree that Syrian influence in Lebanon must be curbed , and all , in theory , approve of Hezbollah &apos;s disarmament -- required by UN Security Council resolution 1559 -- even if they differ over how to bring it about .
Another regional issue shaping Lebanese domestic politics is the ongoing violence between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq .
Lebanon &apos;s Sunnis and Shiites -- the country &apos;s two most powerful communities , owing mostly to their demographic weight and the backing they enjoy from elsewhere in the region -- are nowhere near the point of mutual violence , but there has been palpable political tension recently .
Hariri was the leading Sunni politician , and after his murder both communities found themselves in opposing corners with respect to Syria .
Within Lebanon , the Sunni-Shiite divide reflects broader regional frictions between the Sunni-majority Arab states , particularly Saudi Arabia , which backs Saad Hariri , the late prime minister &apos;s son , and Iran , which supports Hezbollah .
The Saudis fear that Sunni-Shiite discord , spreading from Iraq across the Arab world , might harm the kingdom , whose Shiites are concentrated in the oil-rich eastern part of the country .
That is why Riyadh has encouraged Hariri to keep lines open to Hezbollah , the leading Shiite force .
Their sectarian anxieties aside , the Saudis and Egyptians fear that a nuclear Iran might secure Shiite dominance in the region .
Grafted onto this is America-Iranian enmity , fed by the nuclear issue , but also by disagreement in Iraq .
The Arab states have found themselves uncomfortably caught in the middle , as have the Lebanese , who are alarmed that they may pay the price for any American or Israeli attack against Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , because in either case , Hezbollah may retaliate against Israel from South Lebanon .
Inside Lebanon , Hezbollah has interpreted UN demands for its disarmament as a plot by the Bush administration to weaken the party , and as a means of affirming American supremacy in the region .
Hezbollah has refused to disarm in the face of what it has called the Israeli threat , although its definition of this threat has shifted frequently enough to cast doubt on whether it would ever be willing to surrender its weapons .
More recently , Hezbollah agreed to place the issue on the domestic negotiating agenda -- perhaps because Iran doesn &apos;t want it to be a source of national dissension -- but it is doubtful that genuine disarmament will ensue , at least for now .
Finally , as they maneuver around the shoals of regional and international affairs , the Lebanese must also consider domestic American politics .
Whatever one thinks about the war in Iraq , the US presence there has helped Lebanon to ward off Syrian efforts to reverse its withdrawal , as well as Arab efforts to compel the Lebanese to compromise with a regime that loathes Lebanese sovereignty .
A US administration in full withdrawal from Iraq would likely become indifferent to what happens in Lebanon .
Who but Syria and Iran would benefit from that ?
Such an outcome might satisfy some parts of Lebanese society , particularly Hezbollah .
But most Lebanese remain committed to seeing their country living in peace , free from the isolation and militancy that are the hallmarks of Iran and Syria .
Unfortunately , Lebanon has always been buffeted by its surroundings , and the country could once again become an arena for destructive regional conflicts , regardless of what the Lebanese prefer .
